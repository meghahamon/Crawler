la beast here and today were gonna drop some knowledge direktly in your anus Nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it
Welcome to the Crystal Pepsi movement
Austin tell them how you feel!

It was a brisk on a day when a took my first sip
I fell to the ground when the liquid touched my lips
Frozen by the flavor I could not let it go
but Crystal Pepsi, what? No!
How could this be all this zest in a transparent bottle
Boosting all its flare like an elegant model
What are you doing?
Where have you gone?
The world needs your sparkles so we all sing a song

All that I want is a Crystal Pepsi
To share with you
I haven't been the same since '92
All that I want is a Crystal Pepsi
Yeah you know it's true
I've never seen something that tastes like you

Have a good day!

Have a good day!

Have a good day!

Crystal Pepsi is not just another beverage
It's a way of life!
And when we speak Pepsi will listen!

Roses are red
Violets are blue
Pepsi is brown
But it used to be see through
Those were the days when our Pepsi was clear.
Not a frown to be found when you got a cupful of cheer
So let's celebrate this isn't the end of our road
One day we'll have Crystal Pepsi back in our homes
Save a spot in the fridge for two liters of pop
Because the LA Beast nation can not be stopped

All that I want is a Crystal Pepsi
To share with you
I haven't been the same since '92
All that I want is a Crystal Pepsi
Yeah you know it's true
I've never seen something that tastes like you

Have a good day!

Have a good day!

Have a good day!
