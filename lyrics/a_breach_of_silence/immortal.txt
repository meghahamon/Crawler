Life's path untold to all who walk the frayed and windy road.
Ghosts from the past rise up to haunt their weak and empty soul.
Stick in the sand to mark out our legacy, cut short by the unknown.
Tides rise above you now, washed away, not yet fully grown.

Deceive me, this life was torn away.
Retrieve all the things that make this a better day!
Just once now, I'd like to say, retrieve all the things that make this a better day!

Growing up was the time of our lives, every day we watch the world go by.
We were raised to be kings.
Never fearing the vicious lullaby.
Blinded by fate and virtue, watching life get torn from our arms, I'm standing, waiting now.
Life's warrior bound to be disarmed.

Deceive me, this life was torn away.
Retrieve all the things that make this a better day!
Just once now, I'd like to say, retrieve all the things that make this a better day!

My story falls on deaf ears.
The glory stalled for all these years.
My candle burnt, the light appears.
In death we see truth, twisted tale of sweetened memories.

What I'd give to have you back here standing next to me.
The unknown beast of fate, the vicious one casts out one last cry.
I know you're watching me, the eagle soars until the last one dies.

Deceive me, this life was torn away.
Retrieve all the things that make this a better day!
Just once now, I'd like to say, retrieve all the things that make this a better day!
