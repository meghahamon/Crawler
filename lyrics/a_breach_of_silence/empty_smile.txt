Your blood is haunting me, my only chance to redeem the call.
Come forth my enemies, your eyes will never see the dawn.
Behind the silhouette, the only one too deny the dead.
An empty smile still haunts my dreams and memories.
An empty smile still haunts my dreams and memories.
Before you take my head, you shall repay with your blood.
Before you take me down, the axe wielding in your hand comes down.
Forgive me with the mask that hides your smile.
An empty smile still haunts my dreams in memories.
An empty smile still haunts my dreams in memories.
Your blood frozen cold!
My life will sail ashore.
From which we remain.
My life will sail ashore.
From which it shall remain.
Do you remember
(do you remember).
I fucking remember
(fucking remember).
For every time.
Your heart needs remedy.
For every time.
Your heart needs remedy.
And for virtue,
your heart needs remedy.
And my heart screams.
Your heart needs remedy.
