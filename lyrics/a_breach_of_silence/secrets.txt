Lies can hurt and lies can burn.
But lying to me means you never learn.
From your mistakes we can see that you're fake.
And you never learn and you never learn.
You know that I know.
I can tell from your head to your toes.
You can't keep secrets.
I can tell from the look on your face.
You can't keep secrets.
Strung out, with my eyes wide open.
Too many words unspoken.
And I will take this to my grave.
Cut the life from me, now take me away.
Secrets can hurt and secrets can burn.
But the secrets I've kept are none of your concern.
And will you ever learn?
And will you ever learn?
You know that I know.
I can tell from your head to your toes.
You can't keep secrets.
I can tell from the look on your face.
You can't keep secrets.
I told you right from the start that this was none of your concern.
The writings on the wall and that's another lesson learned.
Here I am to make a stand and show the world just who I am.
Here I am to say to you.
Not everything you hear is true.
Take me away from this evolution.
Take me away from this evolution.
You know that I know.
I can tell from your head to your toes.
You can't keep secrets.
I can tell from the look on your face.
You can't keep secrets
