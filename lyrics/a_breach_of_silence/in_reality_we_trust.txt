Put the gun to your head.
Feel the pressure taste the lead.
Open your eyes and you will see, not everything is your reality.
Put the gun to your head.
Feel the pressure taste the lead.
Open your eyes and you will see, not everything is your reality.
Look to the sky.
Stare into the light, and tell me what you believe in now.
You can't trust everything that you've been told.
There is no savior.
Give me something to believe in.
I feel like I am lost at sea.
Save me from this fucking ocean.
I need to find what's left in me.
Follow me. Follow me.
Now my back is up against the wall.
So tell me what the fuck do you stand for? Put the gun to your head.
Feel the pressure taste the lead.
Open your eyes and you will see, not everything is your reality.
I've given up on faith and falling to my knees.
Falling to my knees.
Yeah! Give me a reason to carry on, when all hope is gone! Look at what you've done.
You were so lost. Look at what you've done.
All hope is gone. Look at what you've done.
You were so lost, all hope is gone. Look to the sky.
Stare into the light, and tell me what you believe in now.
You can't trust everything that you've been told.
There is no savior. Follow me. Follow me.
Now my back is up against the wall.
So tell me what the fuck do you stand for? Put the gun to your head.
Feel the pressure taste the lead.
Open your eyes and you will see.
Not everything is your reality.
Put the gun to your head.
Feel the pressure taste the lead.
Open your eyes and you will see.
Not everything is your reality.
