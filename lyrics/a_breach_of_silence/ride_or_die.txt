I feel so numb that I can hardly feel.
I hear your voice and I know that this is real.
I know this is real.
Through thick and thin we stay true to each other.
Recognise the bond we have is only growing stronger.
It grows stronger.
They see the roses but we see the thorns.
My ride or die.
She's by my side.
Hearts in the wind.
It's ours tonight.
Drop the bomb nothing matters at all.
We take a stand and we stand tall.
We stand tall.
We stand tall.
My ride or die.
She's by my side.
Hearts in the wind.
It's ours tonight.
They see the roses but we see the thorns.
My ride or die.
She's by my side.
Hearts in the wind.
It's ours tonight.
My ride or die.
She's by my side.
Hearts in the wind.
It's ours tonight.
They see the roses but we see the thorns.
