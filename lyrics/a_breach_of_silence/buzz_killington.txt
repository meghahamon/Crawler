I've got dirt on my face, on my hands, on my knees.
I've fallen down and I am starting to bleed.
I've fallen apart but I've come back strong.
I've taken this journey to find where I belong.
So come with me if you want to see.
I'm telling you this is an emergency.
You'll want to cry and you'll want to flee.
This poisonous anxiety.
Washed up beaten, I don't care at all.
And you won't see me fall.
And you won't see me falling down.
The darkest road is the only way to get out of this.
To find your bliss.
The darkest path is where I will ride.
I won't die.
My spirits high.
The story is written.
So let's just keep on living.
Washed up beaten, I don't care at all.
And you won't see me fall.
And you won't see me falling down.
One day all of you will see.
All this rage pent up inside of me.
I won't break or fall to my knees.
My persistence.
My priority.
Washed up beaten, I don't care at all.
And you won't see me fall.
And you won't see me falling down
