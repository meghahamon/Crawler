This is a message for the youth of our nation.
You need to see through the walls they create.
Look through the window to see the perception.
Nightcrawler's preach nothing but hate.
We exist in this life wasting away.
Your opinions are blind cause you take what they say.
And I mean when I say judgement of you occurs every day.
Like a shark you swim in the dark as you rip us apart.
But like a cage.
You will never take me.
You will never break me.
I need you all to let it go.
You will never take me.
You will never break me ever again.
This is a message for the youth of our nation.
You need to see through the walls they create.
Look through the window to see the perception.
Nightcrawler's preach nothing but hate.
If you live like me then maybe you will see.
You made a mistake.
I can't help but plead.
But I feel that I'm way too late.
And I mean when I say judgement of you occurs every day.
Like a shark you swim in the dark as you rip us apart.
But like a cage.
You will never take me.
You will never break me.
I need you all to let it go.
You will never take me.
You will never break me ever again.
When angels seem to burn and demons seem to pray.
You will never take me and I will never break.
You won't see truth in a sinners lies.
Take off the blindfold and open your eyes.
Like a shark you swim in the dark as you rip us apart.
But like a cage.
You will never take me.
You will never break me.
I need you all to let it go.
You will never take me.
You will never break me ever again
