The air is freezing.
It's hard to swallow.
I close my eyes and live for the moment.
And through the darkness there comes a light.
I crawl towards it and it shines so bright.
I've got the world at my feet tonight.
Wait for me.
We're not gonna break.
We're not gonna break.
Take my hand.
We won't go away.
We won't go away.
I give you everything.
I give you all of me.
We're all in this.
We live for this moment.
And this is everything that I live for.
And all the reasons I can't ignore.
Wait for me.
We're not gonna break.
We're not gonna break.
Take my hand.
We won't go away.
We won't go away.
What if I told you none of this was easy.
None of this was given to me.
I've been down more times than up.
But all of this is worth living for.
I wonder where I've come from and where I'll go.
I wonder will I ever find my way back home.
Wait for me.
We're not gonna break.
We're not gonna break.
Take my hand.
We won't go away.
We won't go away
