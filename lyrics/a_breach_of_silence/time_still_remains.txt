As we journey through the void of time and space.
Darkened path of answers I cannot retrace.
Look upwards to the midnight starry sky.
Realize the bigger picture within its eyes.

Your eyes unveil the map of everything.
Perception tangles dreams, your mind, it sings.
Behold infinity, what time will bring.
The wisdom to behold life's true meaning.

Time still remains, these broken words can't save the day.
Fate to be explained.
Earth is bound to what remains.

We venture forward blind, we fail to see.
Marching to the drum of mediocrity.
Connected to everything we hear the cries of our inner souls, because we realize that,

Time still remains, these broken words can't save the day.
Fate to be explained.
Earth is bound to what remains.

Time still remains, these broken words can't save the day.
Fate to be explained.
Earth is bound to what remains.

Time still remains, these broken words can't save the day.
Fate to be explained.
Earth is bound to what remains.
