I will take it out on you.
Everything I hold against you.
Eyes set to kill me.
I'm lifeless within your final breath, final breath.
I will never take it back off you.
Everything that I have put you through.
Now everything has changed.
And you're the one to blame.
I will never take it back down on you.
Eyes set to kill me.
I'm lifeless within your final breath, final breath.
Your blood frozen cold.
No more tyranny, just watching you bleed.
Watching you bleed!
No more tyranny, I will not bow down!
This is my final breath I'll ever breathe.
I'll ever breathe in you.
My final breath, I'll ever breathe.
I'll ever breathe in you.
