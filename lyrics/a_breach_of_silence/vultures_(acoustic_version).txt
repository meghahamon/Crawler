When you're burnt out and weak, when you're torn down to your knees.
Is there anybody out there?
When there's vultures at your back, the light is dying now.

Is there anybody out there?
When you're lost in your head, when you feel like you're dead.

Is there anybody out there?

Locked away forever safe and never to be shown.
I'll sacrifice every single bone to protect the lessons learned, my worth

When you're broken, when you're weak, when you're torn down to your knees, when there's vultures at your back, the light is dying now.

You are only as strong as the army that follows your lead.
When you're burnt out and weak, when you're torn down to your knees.
