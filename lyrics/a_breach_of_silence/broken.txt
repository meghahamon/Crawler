I need to trust my faith to pull myself together.
But this mountain seems too high.
I feel my life slipping I can't find my way home.
Waiting for the end.
I'm waiting.
Take my hand.
Waiting.
You know I've seen too much.
Take my hand.
And I can already feel your touch and I'm praying.
Take my hand.
The poison seems to keep the voices from screaming inside my head.
But the demons they whisper in my ear.
They smile at me and they cheer.
I wish I could fix this.
Waiting for the end.
I'm waiting.
Take my hand.
Waiting.
You know I've seen too much.
Take my hand.
And I can already feel your touch and I'm praying.
Take my hand.
Take my hand.
Waiting for the end.
I'm waiting.
Take my hand.
Waiting.
You know I've seen too much.
Take my hand.
And I can already feel your touch and I'm praying.
Take my hand.
Have you ever felt this way before?
I'm at the bottom of the bottle and I'm face down on the floor.
I shiver with the cold and the tears won't come.
I'm broken.
I'm broken.
