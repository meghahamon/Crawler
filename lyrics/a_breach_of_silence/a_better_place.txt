All of the years and memories of you, give me reason to push through.
I know what I got myself into.
Can you find me?
Where are you?
We are taking over.
We're on the route to nowhere with every window down.
We are taking over.
We're cruising down these streets all night with no destination.
Where are you now?
All of the years and memories of you, give me reason to push through.
I know what I got myself into.
Can you find me?
Where are you?
I would walk the earth just to see your face.
And every time I feel your soul it takes me to a better place.
I stand and wonder where you went.
I can feel your breath.
I can smell your scent.
We're taking over the world tonight.
You can help me feel alive.
We're taking over the world tonight.
I've never felt so alive.
Where are you now?
All of the years and memories of you, give me reason to push through.
I know what I got myself into.
Can you find me?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
