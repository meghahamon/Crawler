You're up so high on your throne looking down.
Go take a look in the mirror.
Where did this all go wrong?
Where did we all go wrong?
The flood gates of your life come crashing down.
Crashing down.
Where did this all go wrong?
Where did we all go wrong?
You've lost touch with yourself.
The pieces fade away tonight.
And I wonder why.
You are living a lie.
You're up so high on your throne looking down.
Go take a look in the mirror.
Where did this all go wrong?
Where did we all go wrong?
The flood gates of your life come crashing down.
Crashing down.
Where did this all go wrong?
Where did we all go wrong?
Karma comes around.
Your intentions fall right out of sight.
And I see you cry.
Tears of goodbye.
What goes up, must come down.
You're gonna fall face first into the ground.
You're up so high on your throne looking down.
Go take a look in the mirror.
Where did this all go wrong?
Where did we all go wrong?
The flood gates of your life come crashing down.
Crashing down.
Where did this all go wrong?
Where did we all go wrong?
