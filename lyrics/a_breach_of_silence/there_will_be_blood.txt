Is there something worth fighting for
No more too repent
Is there something worth dying for through suffering

Seize the day
No more embrace
Truth be told
There will be blood
So no remorse

Too be dead is too be at peace
Engraved is R.I.P
In the grass sitting on my knees
As the pain runs through me
As the pain runs through me

Seize the day
No more embrace
Truth be told
There will be blood
So no remorse

No more survivors
There will be blood
There will be no more suffering
As the photo lays in harmony until I take you head
My visions be, lost within
Lost within me, my vengeance will be

Seize the day
No more embrace
Truth be told
There will be blood
So no remorse.
