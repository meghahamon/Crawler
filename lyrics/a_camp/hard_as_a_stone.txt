In the morning and in the evening
When you think you're alone
Too many hours in your apartment
Has made me hard as a stone

I've tried to crack you, I told you you're the one
But you must have thought that I have gone
I told you a lotta lies just to get laid
But your heart is hard as a stone

You're vicious, but I'm a man
I'm gonna do what I can
To remain hard as a stone

That little pigeon, where did you find her?
I had to break her every bone
Eleven hours in your pool
No longer, hard as a stone

She was delicious, now I'm the star
If you wanna be what you are
You've gotta be hard as a stone

Hard as a stone
Ha-ha-ha-hard as a stone

You're mean, but I'm a man
It's not exactly what I planned
But it seems I'm hard as a stone

I'm hard as a stone
Seems I'm hard as a stone
