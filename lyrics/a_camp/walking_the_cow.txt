Walking The Cow
Try to remember
But my feelings
Can't know for sure
Tryin' to reach out
But it's gone

Lucky stars
In your eyes
I'm walking the cow

I really don't know
How i came here
I really don't know
Why i'm staying here
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I am walking (walking)
The cow

Try to point my finger
But the wind
Keeps blowing
Me around in circles
In circles

Lucky stars
In your eyes
I'm walking the cow

I really don't know
What i have to fear
I really don't know
What i have to care for
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I am walking
The cow

Lucky stars
In your eyes
