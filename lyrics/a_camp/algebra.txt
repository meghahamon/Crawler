Why can't you just forget about algebra?
It's all about you now
And all your talk on logic and formula
Could never help you now, not anymore

'Cause you were always on the run
From the darkness in your heart
So you wear it on the outside of your chest

I have taken the liberty
To tell your ghosts to go
Brighten with sunlight and sympathy
They promise not to show for a while

'Cause you were always the little boy
Who couldn't keep it to yourself
So your heart is on the outside of your chest

At the speed of love, you moved inside my home
And nothing is alright if you are still alone
And your heart is waiting that
The sound of you and everyone

Is still you're always on the wrong
From the poison in your love
And your heart is on the outside of your chest
