I was on the first ship to Peru
Charted all the courses like all sailors do
First to cross the Mason-Dixon Line
Overseeing wetbacks for good Californian wine

And I've done it again, done it again, done it again
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again

I was there when Jenny Lind first sang
First to feel the cold Alaskan white man
First to take a trip on LSD
First to vote for Roosevelt back in '33

And I've done it again, done it again, done it again,
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.

Yes I've seen it, yes I've seen it
And if you're feeling great, you know I feel it
Yes I feel it

And I've done it again, done it again, done it again
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again

And I've done it again, done it again, done it again
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again
