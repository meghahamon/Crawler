The night's on the edge now
Hanging low against the tide
The world is at it's best now
When the loveless ones collide

It's a long night, a beautiful night
And we're the first leftovers of the night

I'm thinking 'bout the last times
And the people I had to hurt
I wonder why they couldn't touch
And why I never gave it up

You weren't hard to find
You didn't run and hide
We were the first leftovers of the night
Hide of the night

The silence is a burden
When you don't really want to talk
I'm trying really hard now
To set alight my sleepy heart

We made a pretty sight
It seems we've found some pride
In being the first leftovers of the night
Hide of the night, of the night

And everything is alright now
Everything is alright now
Everything is alright

You're not what I was after
But I'm happy with what I found
To dream of new beginnings
When the end is all around

I think you're alright, you qualify
For being my supernova
It's a gambling life, a lonely strife
But I think we're the best leftovers of the night
Hide of the night

And everything is alright now
Oh, everything is alright now
Everything is alright
