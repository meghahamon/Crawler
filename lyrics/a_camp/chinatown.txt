Every town has a secret heart that beats
And every citizen an underground
I set my clock to a bootleg meter
And broken hands spinning round and round

I'm on my way just like every day to get milk and kerosene
But my reflection in the butcher's window isn't me
I freeze

This is Chinatown
A state of mind
This is Chinatown
It's just a state of mind

The sky was blue but I wouldn't know
I was counting cracks in the concrete
I'd memorized them from A to B
A choreography, a part of me

It's not the future, it's not the past, it's not now
The price will double if you try to look them in the eye
Don't ask why

'Cause this is Chinatown
A state of mind
This is Chinatown
A state of mind
In Chinatown

Read my fortune in my metro card
You'll see nothing if you search too hard
Read my fortune in my metro card
You'll see nothing if you search too hard
