Come on baby sing
Of the oddness of the lord
It's about time we sang
Of the strange ways of the lord

The oddness of the lord
The oddness of the lord

Come on baby sing
Of the oddness of the lord
The strange ways of the lord
The sacred and the cursed

It's never getting better, no, no, no
It's only getting worse

Come on people sing
Of the oddness of the lord
Everybody sing
Of the strange ways of the lord

The oddness of the lord, oh oh oh
The sacred and the cursed

It's never getting better, no, no, no
It's only getting worse

It's never getting better, no no no
No, no
