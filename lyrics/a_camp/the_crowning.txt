Brighten the corners and clear out the room
Color the flowers in rose and maroon
Light up the fires and season the swine
We're gonna party like it's 1699

Slaughter the rabbits, the doves and the boars
And lay all the tables and open the doors
The creme de la creme will be waiting on one guest of honor

Oh, up go the curtains and down go the virgins
Oh no, mothers are crying
Ladies of virtue will stand to accuse you of heartbreak and theft

Bells are gonna ring, birds are gonna sing
Let the people begin the crowning of your big head

Young drunken girls in a hideous dance
Sing a heartfelt lament of the death of romance
Beautiful boys turn and offer their cheeks
Preening and prancing, the outcome looks bleak

Good times are rolling but outside these walls
Our houses will crumble, this city will fall
But a few broken pawns don't mean nothing to our guest of honor

So let's raise our glasses to murderous asses like you
May you sleep soundly
Once we had laughter, you got what you're after, oh, you wear it well

Bells are gonna ring, birds are gonna sing
Let the people begin, hear how the hearts are pounding
We're all witnessing the crowning of your big bleeding head

Birds are gonna sing, bells are gonna ring
Let the people begin, hear how the hearts are pounding
Your rise, nothing but astounding
We're all witnessing the crowning of your useless ruthless head
