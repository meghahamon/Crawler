Something's watching over me
There's someone in my house that I can't see
I've asked her many times to leave
She tells me she's not evil

In my hours of confidence
When feeling real and worthy of my friends
When I let go of my defense
She's waiting in a corner

Angel of sadness leave me alone
Save me some hours to try on my own
When the music is over the silence is on
You know I will be yours alone
So pick me up and carry me home

Life with her is getting hard
It's like I'm not the driver of my own car
I'm not the holder of my credit card
Oh Jesus, make me sober

Misery comes and lovers go
I lose myself and sometimes I don't know
She says I've always told you so
But I'll stay with you forever

Angel of sadness leave me alone
Save me some hours to try on my own
When the music is over the silence is on
You know I will be yours alone
So pick me up and carry me home

Angel of sadness angel of grief
Save me some hours and please can you leave
When the music is over the silence is on
I'll be completely on my own
But I'll work it out and find me a home
