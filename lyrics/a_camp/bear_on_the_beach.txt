Iris in the morning rain sitting in a sea
It's hard to tell the blues apart, she's salty just like me
She thinks she's on an island or she wishes that she were
She thinks she hears the sirens but I think it's only
Iris in the morning rain sitting in a sea

She didn't wanna see, the fruit was out of reach
She's caught between the ocean and the bear upon the beach
Imaginary waves could never drown you
And I didn't want to tell her, I didn't want to tell her

Iris on a ladder climbing closer to the sky
Iris
Rising from the grind, she is a quitter just like I
High rise

Sitting on a rooftop watching molecules collide
Safe above it all she's drinking mercury on ice
Iris on a ladder climbing closer to the sky
Iris

She didn't wanna see the stars were out of reach
She's caught between the ocean and the bear upon the beach
Imaginary gods could never save you
And I didn't want to tell her, I didn't want to tell her

She didn't wanna see the stars were out of reach
She's caught between the ocean and the bear upon the beach
Imaginary gods could never save you
But I didn't want to tell her, I didn't want to tell her
I didn't want to tell her, I didn't want to tell her
