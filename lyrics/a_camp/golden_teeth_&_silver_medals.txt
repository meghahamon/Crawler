Anybody tell you that there is no resale value
When your romance goes to hell
You better say farewell to what you thought was wealth

Ever get the feeling that the paint has started peeling
Are you staring at the ceiling of your castle
Dreaming that you're someone else?

Would you like to meet me in this song?
I've been hoping to
Would you like to come and prove me wrong?
No, I'll agree with you

Golden teeth and silver medals, beauty marks and scars
That is what we got
Raindrops in a reservoir and minutes in a jar
That is what we got

Maybe if I had another drink
I'd see the pattern in the blinking of the traffic lights
Do you think you're happy, Nicolai?

I don't know the answer, Nina, life is like a melody
A pendulum that swings between the major and the minor
It's a lullaby

Now, I'm so glad I met you in this song
It's just a breath I'll throw
I'm so glad you're here to sing along
My voice into the flow

Golden teeth and silver medals, beauty marks and scars
That is what we got
Raindrops in a reservoir and minutes in a jar
That is what we got

I'm a little worried that the worst is yet to come
I'm afraid they'll leave us out here melting in the sun
We'll be second best until we know we have won

But until we do we'll sing this song
'Til we know we've won
We'll sing until our need for it is gone
We'll be singing this song

Golden teeth and silver medals, beauty marks and scars
That is what we got
Raindrops in a reservoir and minutes in a jar
That is what we got

Golden teeth and silver medals, beauty marks and scars
That is what we got
Raindrops in a reservoir and minutes in a jar
That is what we got
