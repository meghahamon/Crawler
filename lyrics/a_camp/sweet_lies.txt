Baby please keep telling sweet lies

My mistake was loving you
Much more than your loving me
And though you say that your heart is true
Your words are guanteed
Well i suspect but i don't dare so cross your heart and darling swear
That the moon and the stars you'll always be there

No don't stop telling these sweet sweet lies
Or you know my hearts gonna break
I guess thats why they say love is blind
So keep on telling sweet lies

Always seems like your somewhere else
Somewhere i just cannot be
Lets get back to the way love fades
Coz i don't wanna believe
That my intuition right
Say you'll stay and save my life
Say that the loving your heart
will be burning bright

No don't stop telling these sweet sweet lies
Or you know my hearts gonna break
I guess thats why they say love is blind
So keep on telling sweet lies

So if i'm a fool
If i'm loving i'm not
Or if i'm gonna swallow my pride
And it's a small sacrifice

No don't stop telling these sweet sweet lies
Or you know my hearts gonna break
I guess thats why they say love is blind
So keep on telling sweet lies

So tell me baby there'll be no other
Don't brake my heart no i don't want this lover
Coz me and you baby can make it alright
Baby please keep telling sweet lies

Keep telling those sweet sweet lies

Swear it baby
Swear you'll alwayz be there
Save my life and promise me you'll be there
Say you'll stay
And stay for all time
Baby please keep telling sweet lies

No don't stop telling these sweet sweet lies
Or you know my hearts gonna break
I guess thats why they say love is blind
So keep on telling sweet lies

sweet lies
sweet lies
sweet lies
