Darlin', darlin', the moon went out tonight
And I'm caught like a doe in your headlights
Oh yeah, alright, I'm yours to knock around
I'm a little too starstruck to wanna fight

Oo-e-oo-ee, it's a cold hearted world
oo-e-oo-ee-oo , I'm gonna be your girl
It's a little too late to cry
You're my America

Not quite, snow white, it came down all night
And put a filter of ash on the sunrise
Oh yeah, alright, move a little bit closer
Lay your big dirty hands on my innocence

Oo-e-oo-ee, it's a cold hearted world
oo-e-oo-ee-oo , I'm gonna be your girl
It's just a little too late to cry
You're my America

Ooh, heaven laughs at us now, baby
But we'll be shootin' it down, honey
It's a little too late to hope and pray for a miracle
You're my America

Hey rockstar, you're my America
Hey rockstar, you're my America
You're my America, aah ha
