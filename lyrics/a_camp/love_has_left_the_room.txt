Love has left the room
The party is over but I can't get sober
Obsession is towing me deep down, down

Love has left the room
It fled out the back door when all that I asked for
Was forever more or a real bye, bye
It didn't say bye, bye

And I'll let go if you just tell me
Give back the pieces of dreams that you sell me
They trick my mind

I'll let go if you just let me
I will forget you if you will forget me
I'll slip your mind, I will slip your mind

Tie me to the mast
Cast me in irons, I hear the sirens
They sing of desire, the fatal kind

This love is my last
My final possession, most violent caress
It's a beautiful mess and it's deep down, down
It's really deep down, down

And I'll let go if you just tell me
Give back the pieces of dreams that you sell me
They trick my mind

I'll let go if you just let me
I will forget you if you will forget me
I'll slip your mind, I will slip your mind

Once it settles down and the fire has burned out
What do you think you'll find poking through the embers
Memories that sting little splinters of your doubt
Things that you can live without

So why die
Give back the pieces of dreams that you sell me
And trick my mind

I'll let go if you just let me
I will forget you if you will forget me
I'll slip your mind, I will slip your mind

I will slip your mind, I will slip your mind
I will slip your mind, I will slip your mind
