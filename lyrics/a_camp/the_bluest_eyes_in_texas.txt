That lonesome Texas sun was setting slow
And in the rear view mirror, I watched it go
I can still see the wind in her golden hair
I close my eyes for a moment, I'm still there

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind

Where did I go wrong?
Did I wait too long or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

Another town, another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely way before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind

Where did I go wrong?
Did I wait too long or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

For every heart you break
You pay the price
But I can't forget the tears
In her blue eyes

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind

Where did I go wrong?
Did I wait too long or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
The bluest eyes, the bluest eyes
Are haunting me
The bluest eyes, tonight
