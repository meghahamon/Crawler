Hey!
Does she know where you've been and
all the things that you keep hidden?
Behind those doors, you're not as innocent as you look,
with that crooked smile.
You make your way into the room, thinking that you're "oh so smooth"
Then she believes everything you say.
But i know the game that you are playin'
Don't you know by now how fake he is?
With the show he puts on everyday.
It's so hard for me to let you go,
there's so many things i want you to know.
Whatever you want tonight, she'll be waiting by your side.
Your side.
Hey!
Does she know about the others,
the late night phone calls and how you get together?
When she's away.
sometimes she stays awake thinking of everything she's missing.
and how she feels,
like its something that she did to make you do this.
But the truth is that you can't see the
hurt in her eyes everytime she sees you leave.
Don't you know by now how fake he is?
With the show he puts on everyday.
It's so hard for me to let you go,
there's so many things i want you to know.
Whatever you want tonight, she'll be waiting by your side.
Your side.
