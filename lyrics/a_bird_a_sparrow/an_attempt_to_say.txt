I remember every word you said to me 
I remember every breath you stole 
And that won't get you very far now 
I will know it and soon you will know it too 
Let's play our cards and hope for the best 
Distractions and setbacks predicting the outcome 
I will know it and soon you will know it too

Let's run away as fast as we can 
To a place where no one has ever been
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid 
But as long as you're here I'm here to stay

Are there words that are sweet enough to say? 
Everything that I wanted to explain
The way you take my breath away 
And I know we'll have nothing but the best intentions 
I'm always caught between these miles and my wild ambitions

I'll hold my breath 'till I see you 
So don't mind me if I look a little blue 
I want to save every gasp of air, to make sure...
