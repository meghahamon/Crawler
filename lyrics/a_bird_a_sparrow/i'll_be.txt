Take a look at me.
I feel stronger by your side
I remember when
when I first caught the light
shine into your eyes
and saw who I needed to be.

(chorus)
I'll be the sand that slows you down
I'll be the song when you hear no sound
You're everything I need
Everything I see
When I go away you're what I'm missing

Are you listening?

You've got me on my toes
Wishing and wanting
On everything I know
Just to be close to you
I just want to go 
Whenever you need me to be

(Chorus)

can you hear me?
you're screaming at the top of my lungs
my heart is beating in time with this clock
it needs to go faster
cuz every minute counts
when i am with her

I'll be the sand that slows you down
I'll be the song when you hear no sound
I'll be the sand that slows you down
I'll be the song when you hear no sound
You're everything I need
Everything I see
When I go away you're what I'm missing
are you listening?
