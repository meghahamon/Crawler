Five years coming behind me
Heartbreaks I've put beside me
It doesn't make me wonder why
All this time of my love
I do it all again
So why can't competing
For these little beatings
I don't really know you enough
I've seen the life of fake plastic lies
It's not what it's about
It's all right
It's all right
And now you do, and now you do
I do remember you
And now it's seems so long since we last met
I know
So when you come in to find me
I will not look behind me
So don't make wonder why
All this time that I lost
I know you really are
So tell me a reason
I stop believing
I don't really know you enough
I've seen your lies and all that's inside
It's not what it's about
It's all right
It's all right
And now you do, and now you do
I do remember you
And now it's seems so long since we last met
At a courthouse mountain that we could regret
It's not what I'm told, I know
No, it won't belong if you fold my hand
And it won't belong if you would just understand
It won't belong if you fold my hand
And it won't belong
I won't be, no, I won't be, no, I won't be Now I swear in my heart
Oh, for this year
As we're moving away from what went wrong
I'll just tell her how far we've grown
I just know it's here inside
So I say goodbye
