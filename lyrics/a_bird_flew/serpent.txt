You left me 
You left me now 
I'm pissed 

You're a serpent 
Scaly and cold 
A serpent 
A lying bitch 
Can't stand you 
Why'd you do that to me? 

I can be sweet 
Or I can be sour 
It all depends on how you treat you 
You treat me good, you get it 
You treat me bad, you'll see 

You're a serpent 
Scaly and cold 
A serpent 
A lying bitch 
Can't stand you 
Why'd you do that to me? 

It's a disgrace 
A disgrace 
You ashamed me 
Now watch your back 

You're a serpent 
Scaly and cold 
A serpent 
A lying bitch 
Can't stand you. 
I don't need a tramp like you
