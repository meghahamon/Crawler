She said come take me away
Help me stop counting my days
You can be my emptyâ€¦

Too late, once again,
I let you go because I was afraid of the unknown
Jealousy living in our skin
Disregarding our better thinking
Let's drink to a life that's more than breathing
Toast to a night that soon is giving up on this
I'm choking on these premeditated words

This is the end of feeling real
We all have scars that never heal
Just swear this night will last forever
And I swear I'll never go

Summer's fading to fall
Please believe that we're all just wasting time
Quick, this night's almost gone
Help me take what was wrong and make it right

We're all just remnants of the past
Lost in what could have been or what's become
Let go of what you used to have
And make this life be worth your fucking time

Just looking back on all these years
One too many nights succumb to fear

Summer's fading to fall
Please believe that we're all just wasting time
Quick, this night's almost gone
Help me take what was wrong and make it right
And make it right

I had a dream last night
We took our chances in disguise
Nothing can touch us
When we're living in tonight
Let your waves crash over me
And take me back in time
To a place where you still had
That crazy look in your eyes

And I hate pictures because they remind me
Of what we used to have

Tell me that this night will last forever
Always being crushed beneath the pressure
Let go of the past

Tell me that this night will last forever
Always being crushed beneath the pressure
Of this empty world
Finally found an exit to my endeavor
Don't ever let this fire turn to an ember
Let go of the past
And make it right
