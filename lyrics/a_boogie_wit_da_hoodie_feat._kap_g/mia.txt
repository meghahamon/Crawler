I be paranoid, I gotta keep one in the head
I got like 30 on me, this killtec right in the bag
I got dirty money, I love it even though this shit is bad
I can't let none of these diamonds get into my head
And all my friends locked up got caught up in the feds
And all my sins washed up, yeah free my nigga Sid
I be close to sayin' shit I ain't supposed to say
Sometimes I wanna go ghost, I might go MIA

Still screaming free the fam, they coming home now
All this ice up on my neck, I got a cold now
How you real, you can't even walk through your hometown
I'm barely home now, 30 on the road now
All these millions buy you your life, this whole pound
Pussy boy you get no love, you get snow pound
Stand 10 toes now
My shit a lowdown
Racks came four down

My niggas kickin' your door down
We ain't gon' put on the floor down
We don't know how we want more now
Roll me your blunt like I'm all old pound
Right from the junk, we on now
Swear no more going broke now
Might do a show in your town
Wait 'til I bring that Ghost out
I'm on the skates no roll bounce

I be paranoid, I gotta keep one in the head
I got like 30 on me, this killtec right in the bag
I got dirty money, I love it even though this shit is bad
I can't let none of these diamonds get into my head
And all my friends locked up got caught up in the feds
And all my sins washed up, yeah free my nigga Sid
I be close to sayin' shit I ain't supposed to say
Sometimes I wanna go ghost, I might go MIA

I might go MIA, bitches all up in my face
I don't go nowhere without my brothers, nigga that's my gang
And all the hoes been in my space just gettin' in the way
I got like 30 on my fingers what more can I say
And I got 30 on my fingers what more can I say, please
I got niggas on the block that shoot from deep like KD

Every night they sellin' white, but please don't call 'em Shady
I got too much on a fight so please don't try to play me
I got too much on a fight so please don't try to play me
I got a Beam for the look, already got good aimin'
I got a team full of crooks, ain't really gotta look crazy
I put beans in the cup, but yeah that's my baby

I be paranoid, I gotta keep one in the head
I got like 30 on me, this killtec right in the bag
I got dirty money, I love it even though this shit is bad
I can't let none of these diamonds get into my head
And all my friends locked up got caught up in the feds
And all my sins washed up, yeah free my nigga Sid
I be close to sayin' shit I ain't supposed to say
Sometimes I wanna go ghost, I might go MIA

I might go MIA
I might go MIA
MIA
I might go MIA
