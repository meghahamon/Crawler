We're all fighting in the dark
But I don't care now
I'm cast in stone with broken arms
You could climb upon this raft
Drift until we starve
I don't care if we don't see land

Cause it's snowing in Paris
It's snowing in Paris
And there's someone in Kansas
Sayin' it's snowing in Paris

We who struggle to survive
Live to curse the sky
The cost is clearly so much life
Tied to the mast of our despair
Still we try to care
You've trodden over so much now

Cause it's snowing in Paris
It's snowing in Paris
And there's someone in Kansas
Sayin' it's snowing in Paris

It's snowing in Paris
It's snowing in Paris
And there's someone in Kansas
Sayin' it's snowing in Paris
