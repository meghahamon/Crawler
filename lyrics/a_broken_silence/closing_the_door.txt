We gain benefits, from a nemesis,
we brought that harder edge to the penmanship
this is a renaissance, a genesis,
see every breath brings you pestilence,
to ridicule and finish you,
cause none of These threats are subliminal,
we not criminals but we sinners too
and patience that's left is so minuscule.
It's been a few and we let it slide
but friendships are not standing the test of time,
can't hit rewind, so be set to find
consequence as we sever ties,
to hold a grudge is a potent drug,
a total buzz (so smoke it up)
cause motives was so corrupt,
such phony fucks gone and blown the trust.
So we closing up...

You find pleasure in tearing down all that we burn for but I found freedom in closing the door
Enough is enough, we're closing it up, we're closing it up

We're militant with diligence our innocence killed by the villainous,
to build again is real revenge, take your thirty peace's of silver man.
Middleman with little scams that give your kicks like a river dance,
we killed your plans of milking bands,
fuck a deal now we deal with a million fans.
Our enterprise, re-energized,
truth serum is piled in this pen of mine,
verify men from mice,
from venomous smiles and pathetic lies.
Like Gemini's with many sides,
there energy spent where the pennies lye,
imbedding spines with machete knives,
now for attempts we be very wise.
Identified. They identified

Memories here be so bitter sweet,
your taking our dreams to the guillotine ()
