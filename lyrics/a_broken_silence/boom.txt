Humanity, act on your destiny…
Boom, we're on the brink of a destruction like…
Boom, we're all so sick of the corruption so…
Boom, your food ain't fit for our consumption so…
Boom

Give me a minute with the CEO please
We've been sitting at these gates the whole week
He needs to tell us why these kids got nosebleeds
I'm gonna drown him in he's toxins down stream

Do your part please, react now
Mother earth is treated like a cash cow
Is it water we need or gas now?
We're not seen as humans on the map now
Your love for riches is mental sickness
Environment's a back seat to big business
You breed division, I see no difference
When we're cut we bleed in crimson

Diagnosis from the symptoms
Modern man has become homer Simpson
You want to sit on the throne to the kingdom?
It won't matter when you're blown to oblivion…

Boom, we're on the brink of a destruction like…
(Boom) we're all so sick of the corruption so…
(Boom) your food ain't fit for our consumption so…
(Boom)

Give me a minute with the CEO please
I want to check he has a human heartbeat
While we're hunting for illuminati
He's dodging taxes like the wolf of Wall Street

The Cost of one blink of an eyelid, now we awake to the laws of Tyrants
We're uprising, no more silence, you don't hear warning sirens
And you don't mind it, it's not on your kin but I'll advise you and enlighten
Our eyes widened to your lying, there's no bright side in this "life of Brian"

Combined we are weaponry
We react, turning apathy to energy
There will be penalties for backing up the enemy
Humanity act on your destiny…
