He wasn't born to privilege, but he was born to scrimmage, realised to this
World, there was more than image, knew to succeed, you must ignore your
Critics, loved his music, but deplored the business, now, you can sell your
Soul and get scores of riches, but in the end result, you'll be torn and
Twisted, lived to the fullest, thought he saw his limits, stayed on his
Principles, was to hardcore to pivot, living to rhyme, but later driven to
Crime, so cool, most would of thought he aint sinned in his life, things
Changed, at the blink of an eye, when he mentioned, 'i just got to do a
Thing for this guy' said, 'I'm choked' looking at his kid, flat broke, five
Years down the track, wish he hid, that dope, his pops always spoke about
Not mixing with bad folk, now they pulled him from a river, just to give
Him a tagged toe.

Sickness, of living for friends, bad habits of drinking, didn't pay
Dividends, wife gave him the ultimatum, leave or make ends, meet, so for a
While, he lived in deceit, started making that money pile, without bringing
Receipts, Mrs is all smiles, thinking it's sweet, while his palms are
Sweaty, heart skipping a beat, till a night, he got drunk and started
Wetting his beak, dipped up in his mix, he aint slept in a week, a once
Strong figure, got swept off his feet, said, 'I'm in hot water', and I
Guess it was deep, said now, 'I'm probably safer in a cell than the street,
A week later, he knew how well he'd foreseen, selling to some D's, then he
Gave up his team, his crew found him, took his life just to pay for his
Deeds.

Everyday's a trial we facing, pictures in my mind retracing. X4
