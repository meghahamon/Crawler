Born in Bondi with a keen eye for politics,
many got degrees but don't know what knowledge is,
acknowledge his dedication to the truth
and he never changed name just for chasing lute.
So today he remains of the few,
ain't here for fame, dedication to that news but
Not the news that your seeing on fox
because they label his views as treasonous plots,
believe it or not he's a prize winning professor,
been a front line eye witness to terror,
been threatened to leave countries and had death threats,
made me believe how we deceived by you west press.
And now I know why these secrets are best kept,
right after his readings I be needing a stress test,
a best bet for those not familiar,
check the intellect of Mr. John Pilger.

Real heroes are hard to come by,
lived in darkness but strived for sunshine,
(2 Furious) Sunshine
human race would rise as one kind
if these lies hypnotized our young minds Born to a tribe in a south Africa village, in a country wealth
but without any privilege his land
pillaged by settlers with greed on their mind,
they showed no respect so no peace he could find,
he would read all the time,
be speaking his mind,
be a lead to the blind
so his people would climb,
free speech was a crime in the time that he lived,
apartheid had people divided by skin
and not a guy to give in on a quest to be free,
twenty seven years of life in a penitentiary,
finished off degrees in Bothe law and arts,
so smart, leaving court rooms torn apart,
showed heart like Phar Lap on release from jail,
said "we are all one people let peace prevail"
without fail we raise a glass in health to this fella,
the selfless path of Mr. Nelson Mandela.

Real heroes are hard to find, with super powers that really exist.
That influence the hearts of men.
Who could you turn to if we did not have direction and inspiration
from men like this, from men like this...
