Some its how they brought up, some they got caught up,
Some they been tortured their thoughts stayed dormant,
then they started morphing got hardly any caution,
seemed nutty talking, was buddy's now we awkward.
Touched to many coffins, seen too many lost ones,
many like porcelain cracked in an instant.
Poor to rich kids the off balance to the gifted,
mental states dont discriminate when they penetrate,
like a renegade that saw the fate of my many mates,
on a steady chase inclined to celebrate on any day.
Elevate, getting high I couldnt levitate,
to see the state of their minds and had to get away.
No one demonstrates what to do in situations,
in these cases when they talking too outrageous.
(Damn) So we soon became strangers,
no one educates we knew none of the dangers.

She never lets him see inside,
And he dont ever see the pain thats caught inside
If she could see the world through his eyes
And she dont ever see the pain thats caught inside
We were so blind
We dont ever see the pain thats caught inside
They tried, we tried
We dont ever see the pain

Spent days trying to control that thought train
cause to get to that happiness state we all aim,
trying to find Nirvana some end like Cobain.
Some go bananas can't vent so pour blame.
On your self, cause of wealth, cause of life,
cause you saw your relationship melt with your wife,
cause ya parents hit you with a belt in the eye,
cause ya doctor couldnt find the right pills to prescribe.
Man this is life, this is everyday more of us,
rich or poor?, internal war be borderless.
Scientists been trying to get the core of this,
unlocked doors but be stuck in the corridors.
Horrors of dealing with the unknown,
think your alone but dont know who followed you home, we silent though,
about these issued as a whole so now we missing those that slipped in to there hold... cause

And he dont ever see the pain thats caught inside
If she could see the world through his eyes
And she dont ever see the pain thats caught inside
We were so blind
We dont ever see the pain thats caught inside
They tried, we tried
We dont ever see the pain

Before some ever get to live,
walls collide and we dont ever see the game thats fought inside.
Before some ever get to live walls collide,
and we dont ever see the games thats fought inside.
