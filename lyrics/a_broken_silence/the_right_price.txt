Step on anyone on your mission to rise up, human brethren have been
Listening to liars, killing for wealth or religion is a virus, rebelling
From wisdom that guides us...
Bombs loaded, caught in the moment, no thought just war with opponents, pay
That mortgage with my bonus, no thought of where your home is, gotta get my
Kids tuition, hope the missile hits with precision, to stop a terrorist
Ambition, them or us, quick decision. Hurry up, pick your mission...

(Torcha) We fall for anything, everything has a right price
(Cactus) for better results you need to evolve to move me
(Torcha) destroy enemies, burry them till my minds right
(Cactus) it's taken it's toll, your way to involved to see that you fall
Too easy
(Torcha) we fall for anything, everything has the right price
(Cactus) yeah you fall so easy

Step on anyone on your mission to rise up, human brethren have been
Listening to liars, killing for wealth or religion is a virus, rebelling
From wisdom that guides us...
Bombs loaded strapped to my vest now, so hopeless mad at the west now, been
Told a bomb is my best route, explode and god he will bless thou. My lands
Under occupation and we're branded abominations, circled by a domination,
God damn I've lost my patience. I'm blowing up a station, paradise my
Consolation

(Torcha) We fall for anything, everything has a right price
(Cactus) for better results you need to evolve to move me
(Torcha) destroy enemies, burry them till my minds right
(Cactus) it's taken it's toll, your way to involved to see that you fall
Too easy
(Torcha) we fall for anything, everything has the right price
(Cactus) yeah you fall so easy
