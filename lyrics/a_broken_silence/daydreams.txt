And you could be the one that saves me,
living in my world you know its crazy,
I feel the truth confirming lately,
you could break me out this daydream.
And you could be the one that saves me,
living in my world you know is crazy,
I'm thinking now girl… just maybe,
you could break me out this daydream.

This is my lane, please you won't change me,
these lyrics gaze deep, target main themes,
far from mainstream, best to pave roads,
whether we stay broke or destined for payloads.
I've been wasteful lord is my witness.
Stayed shit faced, burnt all of my bridges,
felt my brain was borderline twisted,
so far from sane when your at a distance.

And you could be the one that saves me,
living in my world you know its crazy,
I feel the truth confirming lately,
you could break me out this daydream.
And you could be the one that saves me,
living in my world you know is crazy,
I'm thinking now girl… just maybe,
you could break me out this daydream.

Iv got a thirsting for the worst things, I should be working, I'm on my third drink. But im gonna turn things that's for certain, hit my straps when they pull back that curtain Cursing cause gee I got squat now, still your pushing me my dreams is your lot now, most weeks I'm leaving to rock crowds, no sleep you see, its one shot now. F the old route it's snap the moulds now, man these cul-de-sacs and traps be my home grounds. Never sold out, but can we hold out, give it another crack, try and pan some gold out. So the loads now bigger than I thought and my remedies been drinking till I'm warped, future id see was vivid in my thoughts and when it blinded me you'd steer me the right course.

And you could be the one that saves me, living in my world you know its crazy, I feel the truth confirming lately, you could break me out this daydream.
And you could be the one that saves me, living in my world you know is crazy, I'm thinking now girl… just maybe, you could break me out this daydream.
