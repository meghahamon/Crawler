You know what, Some didn't speak
Thought they be shut down
and be up in class that clown
knowledge we do seek
but got a need throw that muscle round
stand up or tumble now got drama in abundance now
when thrown in deep some will swim and sure
some will drown
Some will be sheep and thats sweet
If you got good friends
We not all born to lead so our feet just follow footprints
Pushed in a world where to conform is the norm
How quick your dreams can be torn
just getting cought in that storm
But when warned we ain't listening
Them laws we be dissin them
On a course we're going to court is like a christening
Not sure where your mission went
Before it was different
Distorted cause you thought you ought to live for your list of friends

Thats the real in you
Know thats the real in you
Break shackles of the ones that hold back and limit you
Thats what's critical
Know thats whats critical
Empowered to make moves on your own
Thats the pinnacle

You know what
Time fly's like a bird does
from shining up in first class
To finding a first love who lined up and burnt buds
From Riding church busses to a runaway train
Not coping when your folks split
Out unloading that blame
And thats the dumbest of games
But how'd you know any better
Got no focus on clever that only motives vendetta
And all that self medicating on them potions an error
Controls been taken, the rains coming
Hold that umbrella
But when warned we ain't listening
Them laws we be dissin them
On a course we're going to court is like a christening
Not sure where your mission went
Before it was different
Distorted cause you thought you ought to live for your list of friends

Thats the real in you
Know thats the real in you
Break shackles of the ones that hold back and limit you
Thats what's critical
Know thats whats critical
Empowered to make moves on your own
Thats the pinnacle
