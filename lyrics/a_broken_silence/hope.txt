Many are stained with souls corrupt, hope they locate change when old enough. A message that I got when growing up, is drink and smoke pot until ya throwing up. So is the world getting colder… Nah, then I look where them soldiers are, wonder why I just wrote that bar, where we living is poles apart. With open hearts I see people building, a bridge to the world to feed some children, a new light to lead some millions, fight evil, be resilient. Role models saying ‘grip that gun', we Marching to a different drum. Drugs will bring you a fist of funds but make your journey a twisted one. Just begun to see dutys change, seek truth not pursuit of fame. Some choosing to fuel them flames, but they looking like fools today. If the youth decay . Focus dies, time to retrain mobilize, them old ways have been pulverized, we got a new table to roll that dice. Inner demons like a poltergeist, had us living so cold as ice. But now kids got global eyes …. Hopes alive

Like they sing in Liverpool, you'll never walk alone. Any girl any fella from a broken home, anyone neglected in a warring zone, lost their abode and was forced to roam. Still they spoke in the warmest tones, kept Hope as a cornerstone, from these gifts we ought to grow, I quit spitting them morbid poems. Like cortisones to stop the hate swelling, still see pain in locked away felons, still need change and lots of rebelling, use brains we got to be heading, in the right direction, right progression, minds can be quite perplexing, my confession, life is testing and positive thought fights depression, like songs of Micheal, read the Bible, read Koran, heed disciples, love is vital in the eyes of Budda, and even scribes from the tribes of Judah, One word to describe the future…Hope.
