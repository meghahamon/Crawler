VERSE 1
We live in this, this ain't the joke of a conspiracist, just Genesis of a
Control that could be limitless, 'so people come get your benefits, cameras
On all perimeters bordering on ridiculous, 'and we the ones they do
Business with', many predicted this warning to all citizens, ' cause we see
None of these images', true journalists become dissidents.

(Cactus) Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down, you'll never
Silence the voices, silence this voice, give us a way out... way out

Revoked of their privileges, 'So people come get ya benefits', administers
Of militance living terror for villages, 'and we the ones they do business
With', imagine they inflict on us similar type predicaments, 'cause we see
None of these image' assisting their systems deliverance.
