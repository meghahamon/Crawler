So we've been away so long, we've got them stages torn, and we back from
Breaking point, that spot still vacant boys? No room for new-school kids,
Move bitch, that's ludicrous. Please excuse, the fumes are thick, because
For our future a fuse was lit. Look how I'm super rich, my fam, my new born
Kid, no mansions or supped up whips, that cash ain't ruling shit, so as
That roulette spins, I gamble through these chips, could hang on crucifix
To give thanks to the crew I'm with... now!

Rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise, now when the rhythm breaks
Down, when the rhythm breaks down.

Nations doubt, I deliver like a boy on a paper route, but my fam ain't
About for the paper count, they stay devout and face all rounds, undercards
To major bouts, seen stars in rain clouds, recharged waning powers, let's
Make em proud and take the crown... now!
