We live in this, this ain't the joke of a conspiracist, just Genesis of a
Control that could be limitless, 'so people come get your benefits, cameras
On all perimeters bordering on ridiculous, 'and we the ones they do
Business with', many predicted this warning to all citizens, ' cause we see
None of these images', true journalists become dissidents.

(Cactus) Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down, you'll never
Silence the voices, silence this voice, give us a way out... Way out

Stay diligent as we unfold who the villains is, cause innocents still being
Revoked of their privileges, 'So people come get ya benefits', administers
Of militance living terror for villages, 'and we the ones they do business
With', imagine they inflict on us similar type predicaments, 'cause we see
None of these image' assisting their systems deliverance.

(Cactus) Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down, you'll never
Silence the voices, silence this voice, give us a way out... Way out

Bridge
(Torcha) Genesis of a control, that could be limitless, Genesis of a
Control, that could be limitless
(Cactus) Silence the voices, Give us a way out
(Torcha) Genesis of a control, that could be limitless, Genesis of a
Control, that could be limitless, the genesis of a control, that could be
Limitless, (Cactus) Give us a way out, way out
(Torcha) Genesis of a control, that could be limitless,
Genesis of a control, that could be limitless, genesis of a control, that
Could be limitless, (Cactus) Give us a way out

(Cactus) Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down, you'll never
Silence the voices, silence this voice, give us a way out... Way out... Don't
Make us bring you down, give us a way out, way out...
