talk is cheap, of course it's more action that is needed
but where did it get us, overreacting at some meetings
all they do is block the street up at summits with our leaders
keep us back a hundred meters, or lunge trying to beat us
confiscating visas, black choppers & them beamers
we here for that peace, so why them coppers got to greet us
maybe with guilt they filled, built, cause they mislead us
it's heating, as we seeing time revealing all their secrets

if you ever knew what's close, do you think we ready folks
better stop and run a check, on what we heading for
we think we ready though, ‘but we ain't ready no'
when our mind is locked and we be scrapping for that petty dough

some say a world government's unfurling, it's coming quick
you know who controls, who we serve, whose running shit
punishment for not keeping democracy in constant check
pondered yet?, some already that monster threat
not only about iraq, also about tibet
but lives are numbers in their senates and their house of reps
allowing death to rain, courtesy of taxes
an evil axis, and so murderous be their tactics

fact is while these soldiers is strolling through borders
it's obvious, it's for the controlling of resources
corpses are not seen by the one's up in office
but laws are always coming under their auspice's
paupers, they be on the frontline, for yours
my lord, this is more than just punch lines and tell your sons and daughters, it is upon us
reporting, cause i know they lead the blind into the slaughter
