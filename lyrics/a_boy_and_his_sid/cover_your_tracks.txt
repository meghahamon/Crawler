Heart
Cover your Tracks
The blood that you spill
Will wash what you like

Soul
sew up your wounds
test out your engine
give it some room

Break

Mind
Pick up your pace
Capture the fire
you always chase

Soul
open your wings
Lift this cage higher
than any dream

Ooh... 

Cover your tracks

Ooh...

Sew up your wound

Ooh...

Pick up your pain

Open your wings

Ooh...

Heart
flash out your webs
The past that was tangled
will unwrap and shed

Soul
sing out your songs
clear out your troat
and belt it out strong

Cover your tracks
sew up wound
pick up your pain
open your wings
cover your tracks
cover your tracks
