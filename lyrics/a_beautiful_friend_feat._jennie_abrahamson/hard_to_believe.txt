He's got a lot of light in his eyes
Lately he's shining it all on me
Night falls, his hands are my lullaby
He knows how to pull me down to sleep

But days keep marking time
And time keeps marking days
And these days I keep wondering
Why it's so hard to believe?
Why it's so hard to believe?

Spring is here, the sun is high
The birds are singing all around
There's hope and happiness in the air

He's got a lot of love in his heart
Never a worry on his mind
Night falls, his hands are my lullaby
He knows everything's gonna work out fine
