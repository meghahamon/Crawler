You pay for the things you have with kisses you stole from me
This conversation is breaking me
This conversation is breaking me

And I won't let you go for anything, no
I won't let you go for anything, no

I'll put on my happy face, pretend everything will be ok
You substitute me for the next best thing, ill always be your next best thing

And I won't let you go for anything, no
I won't let you go for anything, no

You'll be the death of me in time I'll let you know
And You'll be the death of me in time I'll let you know

Your eyes are the reason my heart is beating
Your smiles the reason that I keep breathing
Your eyes are the reason my heart is beating
Your smile is the reason that I keep breathing
Your love is the reason that I keep screaming
Your love is the reason that I keep screaming
