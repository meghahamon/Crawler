Keep on Keepin' on, 
Out of there, you're gone, 
Want it but you're out, 
Face down stop the count 

You don't break for dawn, 
Keep on Keepin' on, 
No-One stays the same, 
Coming round again, 
(coming round again) 

Everybody get some air, 
Don't nobody go nowhere, 
Everybody hurts a little, 
Woah-oh woah-oh when they come round, 
Everybody, it's the end, 
Don't nobody get the bends, 
Everybody hurts a little, 
Woah-oh woah-oh when they come round. 

Nothin' ever fits, 
Whats the use of it, 
Never gave you away, 
Tears on Christmas day 
(hey!) 

Everybody get some air (Woah-oh) 
Don't nobody go nowhere (Woah-oh) 
Everybody hurts a little, 
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, When they come round. 
Everybody it's the end, (Woah-oh) 
Don't nobody get the bends (Woah-oh) 
Everybody hurts a little 
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, When they come round! 

Everybody get some air (Woah-oh) 
Don't nobody go nowhere (Woah-oh) 
Everybody hurts a little, 
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, When they come round. 
Everybody it's the end! (Woah-oh) 
Don't nobody get the bends (Woah-oh) 
Everybody hurts a little 
Woah-oh, Woah-oh, When they come round! 

When they come round.... 
When they come round.... 
When they come round....
