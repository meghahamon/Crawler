Do ya wanna fight?
I'll stay up all night
Just forget the time

Any time I want to
Any place I need to
I'll be there
Yeah, I'll be alright...

So get out the kitchen
Check out my pigeon
Fed-Ex are massive on my way
Jump on a rock bus
No-one can stop us
We're going bonkers today

Do you know, I'm right!

Just forget the time
Any time I want to
Any place I need to

Yeah, I'll be alright...

We're Cheeky Monkeys
We're Cheeky Monkeys
Just like the Bee Gees
We put the words down so they rhyme
Yeah, we rock in the summer
(Rock in the summer)
And we sleep in the winter
(Sleep in the winter)
Then we park where we want to
(Park where we want to), pay the fine

Yeah, Cheeky Monkeys
Cheeky Monkeys
Do you know, I'm right!
Do ya wanna fight?
I'll stay up all night
Just forget the time
Any time I want to
Any place I need to
I'll be there
Yeah, I'll be alright...
