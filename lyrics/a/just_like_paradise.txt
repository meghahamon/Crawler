Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She's got the stereo and the big guitars
And that's all right (all right)
I got the itch and a restless soul
She's gone with the wind
She's gonna go for broke tonight
And that's all night)
Girl, we've been meant for this
Since we were born
No problems now the coast is clear
It's just the calm before the storm
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't want to go home
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't wanna go home
Suzy, Suzy, girl, for cryin' out loud
You got all the right moves
You make me eat my heart out
Nightly and that's all right with me!
No special favors make it out to cash
We'll need it later
Gotta make this moment last (La-ast)
Some folks say `easy come is easy go'
And some folks say
No problems now the coast is clear
Girl, hang on tight and don't let go
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't want to go home
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't wanna go home
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't want to go home
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't wanna go home
This must be just like livin' in paradise
