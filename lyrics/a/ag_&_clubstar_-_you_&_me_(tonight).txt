AG & Clubstar - You & Me (Tonight)
Have you ever loved someone
But you waited just too long
To tell them what you're feeling
Well maybe I was just too proud
To say I loved you right out loud
I say the words I must believe them..

On this night that holds us both within
Set me free won't let me live again

It's you and me tonight
With these feelings we can fly
Just 2 people lost but maybe be found together
If we make it thru, and tomorrow find the truth
You know I would fall, I won't face the wall
Just for you

Let your inhibitions go inside outside thru
Such a hard feelings running high
Cos tonight it's just me and you

It's you and me tonight
With thesefeelings we can fly
Just 2 people lost but maybe be found together
If we make it thru, and tomorrow find the truth
You know I would fall, I won't face the wall
Just for you
