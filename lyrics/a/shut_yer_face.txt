So come out fighting, seconds out
Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt
Got one thing on your brain, you all act the same
But you're alright

'Cause you are from Venus and I am from Mars
You want your penis as big as your car
Not so good in the sack, so what, d'you want your money back?
Yeah, you're alright

It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you own the place
It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway

It's the way that you're scratching your balls when you walk
You wait till I'm watching the football and then you talk!
You're never wrong, so bring it on
'Cause you're alright

'Cause I come from Venus and you am from Mars
You buy me panties that don't match my bra
Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to
Then you're alright

It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you own the place
It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway

So come on
Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you
Beating you down with my words over you
Too hot to handle, maybe you're mental
You're alright

It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you own the place
It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway

It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you own the place
It's just as far as you can go, without comin' back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway
