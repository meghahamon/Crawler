Something's going on, I don't know what I did
But it worked out fine again
I got you in my song and it sounds like a hit
It's gonna be alright again

We're something to celebrate
The more you love, the more you hate
Who cares about us anyway
Something's going on

Take some time to graduate
Take some time and don't be late
Who cares about us anyway
Something's going on

Nothing's going right, this could go on all night
Gotta raise my game again
You're the same as me, I fit you perfectly
I'll never be the same again

We're something to celebrate
The more you love, the more you hate
Who cares about us anyway
Something's going on

Take some time to graduate
Take some time and don't be late
Who cares about us anyway
Something's going on

I wanna stare at you, I wanna stare at you
I wanna stare at you all night
I wanna stare at you, I wanna stare at you
Wanna be wearing you all night
Yeah, something's going on

We're something to celebrate
The more you love, the more you hate
Who cares about us anyway
Something's going on

Take some time to graduate
Take some time and don't be late
Who cares about us anyway
Something's going on

Yeah, come on
Something's going on
Oh yeah
There's something's going on
