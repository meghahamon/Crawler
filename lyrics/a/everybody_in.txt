Met a man who said he's got a villa down in Africa
I asked him what he's doing here, the weather sucks, what's wrong with ya?

He said he's got a gun, and that he's on the run
He used to have a life but it went wrong

Girlfriend's in a coma
He's promised to look after her
He's written to her favourite bands
He's hoping for Metallica

It all looks pretty grim
He wishes it were him
He used to have a life but it went wrong

And he said
Hey, what you living for?
Hey, what you looking for?
I'm not gonna take it any more
Is anybody there? Is anybody out?
Is anybody up? Is anybody down?

I don't think I can take it any more
I don't think I can take it any more

She's cruising in her wheelchair
She's dressed up like [a mexican]
She's holding up the traffic and there's gonna be an accident

I bet she lives alone
Is anybody home?
She used to have a life but it went wrong

And she says
Hey, what you living for?
Hey, what you learning for?
I'm not gonna take it any more
Is anybody there? Is anybody out?
Is anybody up? Is anybody down?

I don't think I can take it any more
I don't think I can take it any more

Hey, what you living for?
Hey, what you looking for?
I'm not gonna take it any more
Is anybody there? Is anybody out?
Is anybody up? Is anybody down?

I don't think I can take it any more
I don't think I can take it any more
