be happy.

but the crow said..
dont worry be happy.

one plain day,
the pigeon crossed the road and got hit by a car..

the crow said...
dont worry,
BE HAPPY.

when the pigeon heard those words... he started dancing like a ducky!!

the ducky was surprised and started to belt out a new found glory song...

the band of new found glory came to the ducky and started singing failures not flattering...

the ducky was very happy...

all because he crossed the road.
