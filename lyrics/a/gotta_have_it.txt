Uh uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Bout to set it off one time for the cats that be buggin'
Ha, Clark Kid what the deal? Group home, wanna hit?
Wild man rest in peace, Ant-Live, yo, yo, yo, yo

Yo, it's the A P L U, let me tell you
I'm sicker than any nigga that been admitted to Bel View
The rhymes I was born through a pen and my strongest strength
My pen is like a weapon when I hold it at arms length

With Kedar's consent I represent over tracks with Clark Kent
With some super vision from Superman
I get stupid man, you open off the verbal aerobics
I was in the Parkside state of mind when I wrote it

I'm the dopest, when it comes to this one
I'm invisible to ya third eye, you need a fourth or a fifth one
Maybe even a sixth one
Keep the Big Anther on the big gun for pin point accuracy to hit one

Never miss, the professional specialist remember this
The name A plus it's anonymous with excellence
Don't forget that before I have to get the click clack
Give you a wetback believe me it'll be a major set back

I gotta have it, it's automatic, yeah
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it
(Check it out)

It's automatic, what? Take that, take that, take that playboy
I gotta have it, it's automatic, uh
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it

(Yo)
It's automatic
(Check it out)
Uh, take that, take that, take that playboy

A yo, I heard some kids puttin' my name in they childish rhymes
As if I ain't 'bout it, 'bout it enough to handle mine
You little boys pushin' past the point of being annoyed
I'll destroy every rapper on the east of Seaboard

Just to get you I take some steroids turn into a werewolf
Jump in the ring and bite your god damn ear off
If the combat is hand to hand, I bang 'em in
Going bananas man, like a angry orangutan

Double my rhymes walk back to the talk fast
And manufacture the data here on after for all rappers for character
You can smash with the speed of the comic book character
Flash Gordan with verbal phonics spectacular

Hear you in the back of the audio screamin'
Like you want to enter this tournament
Come on bring it on and prepare
To get man slaughtered with deadly force
And my style is causing nausea like the scorpion poison

I gotta have it, it's automatic
(What? What?)
Yeah
So come clean
(Suckas)

And keep it real if you like my sound
(Uh, check it out)
I gotta have it
(Uh, Brooklyn)
It's automatic, yeah
Take that, take that, take that playboy

I gotta have it, it's automatic
(Yeah, yeah)
What? So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it, it's automatic
Yo take that, take that, take that A-Plus

A-Plus it gotta be hip hop's youngest mistrosity
There isn't anyone under twenty one that could rock me
You feelin' this, forty eight track ventriloquist
The actual synthesis passin' out the class syllabus

Just imagine if I rip your crew into fragments
Destroy the evidence so nobody will know it happened
Walking through the neighborhood full of dead men doing head spins
Pickin' em' up like red mans

Lyrically modified to kick the hottest rhyme
At the drop of a dime I limbo below the bottom line
Kick it tight, rhymes sent Method Man to another lifetime
Keep Erykah all to myself 'cause I like dimes

Radiation from the bright shine meltin' MC's with height lines
'Cause I'm very selfish with my mic time
When I recite mine, my rhymes explode like a pipe bomb
Nobody in they right or they left mind can test mine

I gotta have it, it's automatic, uh
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it, it's automatic, what?
Take that, take that, take that top that

I gotta have it, it's automatic, yeah
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
I gotta have it, it's automatic, yo
Take that, take that, take that A-Plus

I gotta have it
(What? What?)
It's automatic, yeah
So come clean and keep it real if you my sound

What, I can have it, take that, take that, take that
That flyish, uh, Clark Kent
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Take that, take that, take that
