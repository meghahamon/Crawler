Anyone is anyone
Coulda been a number one
You're better off at ticking off the competition
It's funny how you never tell
Folks are down your doing well
You're better off to cord it off the competition

Second place is not the way
You never check you never gave
You'll never tie another race
It's not a competition
It's not the taking part that counts
But taking on the large amounts
You can't run out of ticket touts
Competition

Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock

I'm missing that old photograph
Remember when we used to laugh
Kills you when your looking back
It's not a competition
Awarded in the magazines
And everybody needs a dream
I think I know what's wrong with me I'm in the competition

Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock

Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock
Hey, yeah, its all about the rock

Its all about the rock
Its all about the rock
Its all about the rock
Its all about the rock
