Ah, you'll go to hell, some people round here say.
It's a right of passage, Its the right to do some (secur...?....)

Some people, some people
some people find help in their god.
Some people, some people
some people wanna die.

(...?...) c'mon, make up your mind where you're going.

Some people, some people
some people find help in their god.
Some people, some people
some people wanna die.

Some people, some people
some people find help in their god.
Some people, some people
some people wanna die.

Some people, some people
some people find help in their god.
Some people, some people
some people wanna die....oh.
