It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go

Save it for the jury
'Cause I don't care anymore
You're not even worthy

It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go

I don't even know you
I don't even want to know
'Cause I think you're mental

It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go

Warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go
