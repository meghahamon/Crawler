Two steps, over, real good, Oh yeah
Lurkin', waiting, goes to the edge of pain and
One steps, too far, in my, backyard
You don't, know me, you can, show me

Sorry I let you, sorry I met you
I need to let you know
You can't have everything
Be careful what you think
You can't have everything
You need to let it go

Your souls, enough, lost soul, my nightmare
Closer, closer, so I can always touch you
Can you think of someone else who only likes to plait my hair
So everybody needs to hug you, everyone needs someone else together

Sorry I let you, sorry I met you
I need to let you know
You can't have everything
I don't care what you think
You can't have everything
You need to let it go
Get up, need to let it go

Sorry I let you, sorry I met you
I need to let you know
You can't have everything
I don't care what you think
You can't have everything
You need to let go

Sorry I let you, sorry I met you
I need to let you know
You can't have everything
I don't care what you think
You can't have everything
You need to let it go
