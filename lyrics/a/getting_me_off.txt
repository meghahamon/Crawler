I have fallen down a manhole
Up the river without paddle
I can't stand up on my own feet
Something came along and bit me

You're all over the place
When she wipes that grin off your face
And you don't know what day it is
Don't even know your name

She's getting me off
She's turning me on
I hope she does that to herself
When I am gone

I don't get the situation
We're an overnight sensation

You feel like you could drop
But she's coming ready or not
And you don't know the place to start
You don't know where to stop

She's getting me off
She's turning me on
I hope she does that to herself
When I am gone

She's checking me out
I'm losing the fight, yeah
I'm so retarded for that girl
And that's alright

You're all over the place
When she wipes that grin off your face
And you don't know what day it is
Don't even know your name

She's checking me out
I'm losing the fight
It's so great
I want to stay home every night

She's getting me off
She's turning me on, yeah
I hope she does that to herself
When I am gone

She's checking me out
I'm losing the fight, yeah
I'm so retarded for that girl
And that's alright

She's getting me off
She's turning me on, yeah
I hope she does that to herself
When I am gone

She's checking me out
I'm losing the fight, yeah
I'm so retarded for that girl
And that's alright

She's getting me off
She's turning me on, yeah
I hope she does that to herself
When I am gone

She's checking me out
