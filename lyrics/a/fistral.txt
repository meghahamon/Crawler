I like the summer like you like your wife
Live in the master for the rest of my life

Every year since I was young
And always here and always fun,
Distant places, stinging faces
All at once I understand it's the summer

Over and over it's summer again
Fills up the sad hole in my head again

Sit for hours just passing vows to
Let their hair down to the sound
Distant places, stinging faces
All at once I understand it's the summer

It's withered flowers and big huge skies
It's high for hours and then it dies

Ocean keeps me up all night
The sunshine makes my hair turn white
You know I hate the winter time
All because there's nothing quite like the summer

It's withered showers and breeze off shore
It's high for hours and back for more
It's withered showers and big, big skies
It's high for hours and then it dies...
