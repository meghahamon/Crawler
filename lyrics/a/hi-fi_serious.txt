Right back at you, record three
Makes you wish that you were me
'Cause we got no job for life
Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright

No two days turn out the same
Only sleeping on the plane
Not exactly monkey days
C'mon, rock it up
From the back to the front, go

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, so come on

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, bring it on

Banshee wailing from my throat
Only dogs can hear the notes
Be myself to pay the bills
From L. A. to Skillmans Hill

We've done time for stealing shows
There ain't nothing we don't know
Plug us in and watch us go
C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump
From the back to the front, go

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, so come on

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, bring it on

Hot, like the desert sky
You're so cool on the inside
You hate being recognized
Going off on outside

Gotta get up, gotta get out
Picking it up
Gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out
Picking it up
Gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out
Picking it up
Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out
Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs

Coming round for one more go
Way too loud for radio
Mosh pit full of casualties
O A P's get in for free

Time to even out the score
Thought we'd done enough before
Now we're kicking down your door
Come on, rock it up

To the back
Measure twice, cut it once
Clear the room
We're barbequeing up for lunch

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, so come on

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, bring it on

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, so come on

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cause I'm hi-fi, hi-fi
I'm serious, bring it on
