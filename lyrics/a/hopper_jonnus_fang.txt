I want to feel important
Want to think im worth it
Still feeling lame in the end
Sit in, in the evening
Talking to my robots
Still feel the same in the end

Spend a little time
Spend a bit more cash
Makes you feel alright
Want to know the truth
I feel the same as you do

Wake up in the morning
Be careful what you ask for
Its never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing
Let em do the talking
Its never gonna do in the end

I want to have a girlfriend
Want a bigger garden
Still feeling same in the end
Move to California
Sell a million albums
Still feel the same in the end

Everybody knows
Better than you know
It makes em feel alright
Want to know the truth
Feel the same as you do

Wake up in the morning
Be careful what you ask for
Its never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing
Let em do the talking
Its never gonna do in the end

Wake up in the morning
Be careful what you ask for
Its never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing
Let em do the talking
Its never gonna do in the end

Wake up in the morning
Be careful what you ask for
Its never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing
Let em do the talking
Its never gonna do in the end
