Afterburner, after burning out, there's a news alert in
And some poor kid who drowned
Operator, operating around
Could you take a chance in our romance, you did nothing about?

Ooh, ooh, take it like a man and do without
Ooh, ooh, it takes a century to figure out
Ooh, ooh, making like we know what it's about
Ooh, ooh, talk about it

After burning out
After burning out
After burning out
Times when I've forgotten you're around

Ten years later, I can't believe its dead
What we lost, you're in without it, started coming 'round again
Space invader, tried it on again
I thought your tape's alone and your face is gone
And they're never gonna end

Ooh, ooh, take it like a man and do without
Ooh, ooh, it takes a century to figure out
Ooh, ooh, making like we know what it's about
Ooh, ooh, talk about it

After burning out
After burning out
After burning out
Times when I've forgotten you're around

And I know this night is another place
It can take another day
So you don't look back again
Don't look back, yeah

After burner
After burning out
After burner
After burning out

After burning out, stay away, you're burning out
After burning out, stay away, you're burning out
After burning out, stay away, you're burning out
