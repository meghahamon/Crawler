Boy, all I see, is you and me
And all I do, is think of you

Yo, I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched and when your smile turned to a blush
[Incomprehensible]
I had to get to know your name

Then I got your number
17 and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know you, 'cause there's things I wanna show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you

Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Everytime I looked at you, you turned and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me losing my mind

With your zodiac sign, my perfect match, in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about us we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see, is you and me
And all I do is, think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away

I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eues when you passed me

Been inside of my head all day, what can I say?
All I can do is reminicse like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G and all that good stuff

Calling you bluff, now look at us
Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did, how we planned to live
How you got rid me of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down

Now look what you found a state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about us we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

I can't get you out of my mind
Think about you all of the time
Wanna get to know you baby, oh

I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew accepted you
Even my ex called you 'cause she wasn't insecure
Feeling got a little hurt but was being mature

Gave her blessings that she learned some valuable lessons
Now she use me as her reference
She's my best friend
Don't even stress, 'cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're Queen, let's bring some unity

Ain't no reason to fight, you know we're keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine

It's all about you boo, and all the things you do
Making dreams come true, buying rings for two
Now it's just be you we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see, is you and me
And all I do, is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away

Boy all I see, is you and me
And all I do, is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away

Boy all I see, is you and me
And all I do, is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away
