Run around, what's the frequency you're on?
Get around, that's addiction you'll get some.
Heart attack, not as big as the next one.
Pulling back, things look different when you're young.
Can't find a, good reason.
Can't fight this way i'm feeling.
These jealous, teenagers,
That laugh at my behaviour.

You'd be better off without me,
Hate to see you sorry,
Days are closing in,
You're better off with him.
Its boring but i'm making,
Promises i'm breaking,
Days are growing thin,
You're better off with,

Anyone, makes no difference just pick one.
Get around, what's the frequency you're on.
You're scared around, conversations you're never wrong.
You're better off, new relations,
You're better off, you're better off

You'd be better off without me,
Hate to see you sorry,
Days are closing in,
You're better off with him.
Its boring but i'm making,
Promises i'm breaking,
Days are growing thin,
You're better off with,

I can't take it anymore, I can't concentrate.
You run around, In my brain, yeah you run around
You're not having fun no more, here's a thousand ways you get around,
In my brain, yeah you get around.
Run around, what's the frequency you're on?
Get around, what's the frequency you're on?

You'd be better off without me,
Hate to see you sorry,
Days are closing in,
You're better off with him.
Its boring but i'm making,
Promises i'm breaking,
Days are growing thin,
You're better off with,
You'd be better off without me,
Hate to see you sorry,
Days are closing in,
You're better off with him.
Its boring but i'm making,
Promises i'm breaking,
Days are growing thin,
You're better off.
You're better off.
You're better off with him...
