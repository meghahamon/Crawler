Yeah, yeah, word up
(Yeah, son)
Yeah, yo, how this goin' down nine six
How we livin' son?
(Exoticness)

Nine six exoticness
(Representin')
Know what I mean?
(A+)

(Yo how we livin'?)
This is New York City
Ninety seven Sosa
A to Z up in the spot representin'

Takin' it back from here, it's supposed to be
Takin' ya back son take it back, check it

Six digit trickin' coke and henny mixin', many listen
Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin'
Its old tradition how we click and fall in position
The rap coalition, we gettin' rich an'

Poetically I'm deadly like a crucifixion, Buddha addiction
Dismissin' competition when they roll wit' friction
My whole crew be schemin' flippy like ixing for that chicken
Smith brothas and A on ya Mason Dixon

Who want the steel cap feel the real rap
Patiently my whole crew waited and we rock premeditated
Chucked underground like the rap genie
And watch the shore by the rising tide now the whole world can see me

When they get foul that's when my style gets wild
I hang a man in front of a crowd without a trial
KAPOW, yo that's all she wrote end the quote
For frontin' a brotha got a dome and his legs broke

Yeah son, I want it all your crib, cars and beepers
Wit hundred dollar sneakers, my sounds blowin' ya speakers
Burgundy Land Cruisers chrome rims on blue rugers
Lyrical hollow tip slug point trugers

Yo yo yo drug connects, diamond cut bergets drippin' wet
My hole is there from Quebec, got her flippin' checks
What, I push a black Lex with gold on my neck
You rockin' wit' a vest tryin' to catch a hole in ya chest

Firm official, exotic girl but wanna be the ritual
Leavin' lights shine light they've been psyched to slip through
I will abolish, MCs get straight up demolished
Yo my mind is like a nine, I load it up wit' knowledge

Six digit trickin' coke and henny mixin', many listen
Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin'

The realism must continue, where I live is like a battlefield
We all poor but on my block is like a half a mil
Surrounded by the most criminal type of elements
Blunts, stunts, gunshots, broken down developments

It's all illegal, young juveniles wit the desert eagles
Street sweepers, heaters, soon to be retreaters
Its routine, people seem to go through a cycle
So confused, to choose between the Bible or the rifle

Watch em stifle, yo, me an son gone escalate this
And get these papers run some capers while they catch the vapors
Yeah son, don't got no time for no chicken trickin'
It's the lyrical addiction, 'cause me an AZ be politikin'
