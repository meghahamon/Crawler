First stepped off, off the aeroplane
I felt like I've been here before
Took a cabbie down, put a smile on my face
I felt like I could do more

How ace are buildings?
How big are the blocks?
Remind me of London
Stuck in a gridlock

Six foot deep, Bleaker Street
No one leaves town
People smile and look at the time
I look down, I can not see the ground
A man who reads the news says there's no crime

There's no one around
There wasn't a sound
There's nowhere to rest
A vision of death

Fell in love with it, I don't wanna leave it
Don't ever wanna go back
Skateboards are cheaper, won't do any bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96

Minus ten, 1pm east village time
I laugh at your Denver sea bar
Snowstorms, so we walks seventy blocks
Day like this, nothing seems too far

Get in the shot
I don't ask a lot
The weather was frozen
There's wasn't a good shot

Fell in love with it, I don't wanna leave it
Don't ever wanna go back
Skateboards are cheaper, won't do any bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96

Maybe I could be here a long time
Much longer than I plan to stay
No telling when they'll get the airport open
No telling when I'll get away
Trying to tell us nothing's wrong
Trying to get the fire back on
Never lost a day of fun
Silence in the heightened mass of
