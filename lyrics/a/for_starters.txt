Well, we did this once before
And we're giving it some more
And it's OK to be as you are, you know
It's always five on one, you'll notice when we're done
That nobody got hurt
You're the same as what you were, you know, Yeah!

I've got something for starters
Throw it up in the air, and I bet you don't care
We're getting louder

Well, it sounds OK to me, on the desk at ICP
Roll the tape 'cause we're rocking album two
And our manager don't mind
'Cause we put that all behind
We've got another bite
And you know the time is right to rock for you

I've got something for starters
Throw it up in the air, and we really don't care
We're getting louder

Hey, it's another day in 'A'
I'm proud to be myself
'Cause rock made me this way
I said hey, I've got plenty more to say
So let me clear my throat
'Cause I'm not cool Britannia,
Not getting any younger
They hate me at NME
I don't care where you've been,
I don't care for your scene
You make me feel like an amputee

Yeah! I've got something for starters
Throw it up in the air, and we really don't care
We're getting louder

Yeah! I've got something for starters
Throw it up in the air, and we really don't care
We're getting louder
