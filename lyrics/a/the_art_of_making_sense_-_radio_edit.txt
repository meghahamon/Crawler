There's an angel on the corner
And they say she's watching over
Over when we are under
Fall asleep on the ground

Hey
Can you feel it calling your name
Like a storm on a bone in the rain
The pain now going you're not around

Wide awake for the night again
Awake for the night again
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer
Gonna teach you the art of making sense

I gotta rock another city
I gotta break another country
I'm gonna kick it til i'm 50
Or i'm deep in the ground

Hey
Not another bone for the pain
I'm never drinking again
It don't make sense when you're not around

Wide awake for the night again
Awake for the night again
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer
Gonna teach you the art of making sense

There's a devil on the road
There's a devil on the road
There's a devil on the road

I can feel it call your name
The feeling that's keeping me sane
Wide awake when you're not around

Wide awake for the night again
Awake for the night again
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer
Gonna teach you the art of making sense
