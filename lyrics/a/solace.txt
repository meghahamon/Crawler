In the morning falling snow
Is transforming all I know
And all is new today
In my heart it overflows
Through the change I undergo
And nothing's the same
Yeah I find a solace
In your eyes
Can face the silence
By your side
The sky is starless
Ease the darkness
Through the night
Till morning light
I will glorify your name
I will watch over the flame
I will keep on track of my aim
And this I'll undertake
For I'm suddenly awake
And there's no way back
Yeah I find a solace
In your eyes
Can face the silence
By your side
The sky is starless
Ease the darkness
Through the night
Till morning light
I was lost and I was found
Was a shadow underground
Never knew where I was bound
Until you came around
And tender is the night
As you sing lullaby
To the darkness
Yeah I find a solace
In your eyes
Can face the silence
By your side
The sky is starless
Ease the darkness
Through the night
Till morning light
I find a solace
In your eyes
Can face the silence
By your side
The sky is starless
Ease the darkness
Through the night
Till morning light
