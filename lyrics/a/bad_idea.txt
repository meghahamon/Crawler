Bad idea, bad idea
Bad idea, bad idea

Ninety nine per cent is great
The other one percent I hate
Little things keep bugging in my head

Wake up calls, smack and that fashion cafe, friendly fire
GMTV, darker mornings and pay per view, litter dropping
I made a list, I got the lot and all
That stuff is all on top It's not fair but I don't care not me

Rocky Five, Indie shite, K K K, number crunching
Bungee jumping, paying taxes, pavement cracks
Car alarms, dinosaurs and protest songs are

Bad idea, bad idea
Bad idea, bad idea

Give me a B A D I
Give me a D E A
Bad idea
