Listing up you people can't be wrong
Fuck it up punk rockers hear my song
One of us united from the heart or it
Real enough when the spotlights on

Get fists in the air, make out like you care
You give all you got but you don't want to be here
That constant surprise, that look in your eyes
You're the second coming but you ain't mine

Sometimes I look to the sky
I'm a man not a mountain and that's why
Cause you get what you give and I like what I got
And I bet you believe when the crowd roar

Get fists in the air, make out like you care
You give all you got but you don't want to be here
That constant surprise, that look in your eyes
You're the second coming but you ain't mine
You're so cool in other ways when you're recognized

Get fists in the air, make out like you care
You give all you got but you don't want to be here
That constant surprise, that look in your eyes
You're the second coming but you ain't mine
