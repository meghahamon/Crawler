There's radiation in the air
It's hotter than the time of year
We maybe need to shed a layer and calm down
How about we disappear, leave it all, get out of here
Wash your face and start again, give us a break
And take the blame and leave it

Waiting for days, waiting to break
Don't want to hurt nobody
Waiting for you always waiting for you
HEY! but I want you to know
Making me pay, breaking away
Don't want to hurt nobody
Waiting for you, always waiting for you

Fire in the air tonight, fire burns behind your eyes
Took you to the dizzy heights and then you calmed down
How about we learn to drink, freaking out and suffering
A couple more, we hit the floor and that's your lot,
I don't recall you keeping

Waiting for days, waiting to break
Don't want to hurt nobody
Waiting for you always waiting for you
HEY! but I want you to know
Making me pay, breaking away
Don't want to hurt nobody
Waiting for you, always waiting for you
Waiting for you, always waiting for you

I sit all night to watch you cry, and gut your insides
I sit all night to watch you cry, i got your insides

Waiting for days, waiting to break
Don't want to hurt nobody
Waiting for you always waiting for you
HEY! but i want you to know
Making me pay, breaking away
Don't want to hurt nobody
Waiting for you, always waiting for you
Waiting for you, always waiting for you
