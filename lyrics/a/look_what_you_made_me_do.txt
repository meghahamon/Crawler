Oh!

Look what you made me do [x2]

'S Alright, 'S alright
Look what you made me do
'S Alright, 'S alright
Look what you made me do

Double check when there's no-one around,
Never know - I smell my breath again
Will you ever pick me up off the ground
I won't know, and I don't wanna know

I think that I'm in with a chance
And I know, I tell myself again
(Oooh-oooh)
Every bet and I try to break dance and I know
Never see you again

'S Alright 'S alright
Look what you made me do
'S Alright 'S alright
Look what you made me,
Look what you made me do

Get your attention for a second at least
Catch your eye, so I start showing off
(Oooh-oooh)
Bring some breakfast down on Malibu Beach
We can fly, but you don't wanna go
Try to smile without showing my teeth,
Think I'll try to look like I don't care
(Oooh-oooh)
Get the feeling that I thin on my hair
I won't buy - there goes my chance again!

Think when I'm walking, trip when I talk
I know you're laughing.
Look what you made me do
Can't stop moving, embarrass myself
Gave me a red face
Look what you made me do
