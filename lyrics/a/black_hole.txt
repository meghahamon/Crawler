Some days go on forever
Last long into the night
Some days feel like December
Although it's warm on the inside

Forget the middle of summer
I bet you I am alive
We'll wipe the floors together
Nice try

Save it all, you have all the answers
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it
Crying out, you have all the anger
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it
You're a black hole

Some days are complicated, some ways I'll take the blame
Some days I take it all to heart again
This place is made of panic, they check you every mile
Thank God, you're going out for a while

Save it all, you have all the answers
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it
Crying out, you have all the anger
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it
You're a black hole

Nobody noticed what you're talking about
Nobody's got a clue what you're all about
Save it all, save it all
(Rock)

Save it all, you have all the answers
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it
Crying out, you have all the anger
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it
You're a black hole

You're a black hole
You're a black hole
