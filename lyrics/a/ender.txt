Thanks a bunch for staying with us tonight
Over lunch we'll talk about the lights

I need to go now, I need to drive round
I need to lie down

Thanks, I'm stunned, it's time to go
I promise you're the best friend
Then in the end, that wont make it so

I need to go now, I need to drive round
I need to lie down

Probably noticed, probably worth it, just about
Probably noticed, probably worth it, just about

Thanks, thanks a lot
Yeah we love you all
And thanks, please thank your mums
'Cos you are the best that we've ever known

I need to go now, I need to drive round
I need to lie down

Probably noticed, probably worth it, just about
Probably noticed, probably worth it, just about

Everytime I hear you I feel lonesome inside
Everytime I see you I feel happy and around

I need to lie down
I need to go now, I need to lie down
My head's in a spin, the state that I'm in
I need to go now
