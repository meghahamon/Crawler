Coming back at you
Record number two
What a way to start the day

Think you're big enough
With a stronger look
Got no backup plan in case we blow it

It's all the same old stuff
They think it's good enough
It works, and nobody got hurt

It happens every time
Like anybody minds
You're telling me it's just the way it works

Too much work to do
Rocking, new, improved
Keep it in the family

It's not over 'till it's over, anyway
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway

It's not over 'till it's over
It ain't broke so fix it anyway
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Got a second chance
And a fresh advance
What a way to start the week

Sack the formula
There's no need to bother
Got no backup plan so let's not blow it

It's all the same old stuff
They think it's good enough
It works, and nobody got hurt

It happens every time
Like anybody minds
You're telling me it's just the way it works

It's not over 'till it's over, anyway
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway

It's not over 'till it's over
It ain't broke so fix it anyway
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fix it anyway
