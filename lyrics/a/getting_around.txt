All of your friends are famous
You're the man at pulling favours
Is that the best that you can do?
Is that the best that we can do?

You said it before, and you'll say it again
"You're gonna be massive, it's a matter of when"
Is that the best that we could do?
And do we owe it all to you?

You're getting around
You're getting me down

It's not that you're used to failure
You put the hours in, the cheque comes later
Is that the best that you can do
It's time to take on something new

You're moving in circles, your all over LA
You're big with the ladies, so they don't think you're gay
And that's the best that you can do?
And do we owe it all to you?

You're getting around
You're getting me down
You're getting around
You're getting me down

And when it don't work out, you put them on the stand
It's not your fault, you want them eating from your hand
You say the words and everybody leaves
You change you hair before anyone can breathe You don't make sense, and you don't wanna know
You're self defensive, Oh-oh!

You're getting me down
You're getting around
You're getting me down
You're getting around

Is that the best that you can do?
And do we owe it all to you?
Is that the best that you can do?
And do we owe it all to you?

You're getting around
You're getting me down
