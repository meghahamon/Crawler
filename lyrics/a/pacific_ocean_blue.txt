It's okay to beat the living shit from the drum kit
It's okay to take what you don't have, if you want it

It's alright, if that's your way
Water's cold, December, Del Ray
Through those eyes, made me cry
And the summer is forever, it's the endless summer

And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you

And remember what I told ya
The nights in California
It's all about Pacific Ocean blue

It's okay to leave your jacket on in the ocean
It's okay to sing the saddest song, vibrations

Thanks a lot, you can be
What you want, honestly
Magic days, golden nights
And the summer is forever, it's the endless summer

And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you

And remember what I told ya
The nights in California
It's all about Pacific Ocean blue

I don't need no explanation
All I got is best intentions
I got fears too much to mention

You're not there
When I'm scared, terrified
Jump right in, the water's fine

And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you

And remember what I told ya
The nights in California
It's all about Pacific Ocean blue

And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you

And remember what I told ya
The nights in California
It's all about Pacific Ocean blue

And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you

And remember what I told ya
The nights in California
It's all about Pacific Ocean blue
