Five pretty boys for ten shitty years
Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears
I need a reaction, a new revolution
All over the country but they took it away

Took it away, it can't be impossible
Playing the records that they play in hospital
Radio playlist for terminally ill
You can't tell they're miming when you're over the hill

And it goes on
(On, and on, and on)
It goes on, yeah
  (On, and on, and on)

And if you put it like that
You'll be dead some day
Set the record straight
They took it all away

They took it away and left us with nothing
Second-hand hits and a million misses
And nobody means it, they're making up stories
You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the 'tories

I blame myself, I want an easy life
Does it really matter? Ain't worth no suicide
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I'm kicking myself for wasting it all

It goes on
(On, and on, and on)
It goes on, yeah
  (On, and on, and on)

And if you put it like that
You'll be dead some day
Set the record straight
Took it all away

They took it away and left us with nothing
You suffer the pain of your fingers burning
Took it away and left us with nothing
You suffer the pain of your fingers burning

Took it away and left us with nothing
Suffer the pain of your fingers burning
Took it away and left us with nothing
Suffer the pain of your fingers burning

Took it away and left us with nothing
Suffer the pain of your fingers burning
Took it away and left us with nothing

And if you put it like that
You'll be dead some day
Set the record straight
Took it all away
