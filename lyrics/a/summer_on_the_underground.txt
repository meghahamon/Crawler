It's summer on the underground
There's so much sweat a man could drown
There's panic on the overland
Yeah, and London Bridge is falling down

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...

The temperature is ninety-two
It's baking in the vocal booth
And all the tourists come in June
There's so many you can't move

There's people getting rich today
There's people that they've gotta pay
There's lots of places I could go
We should be rockin' in the studio!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
Don't feel like working today, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
I feel like getting away, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
Don't feel like driving today, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
I feel like getting away
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know...

Dalston is a wicked place
At weekends it gets off it's face
And everybody calls you 'mate'
But do they really wanna know?

The drinks machine is running out
And please don't use the ticket touts
The ladies have it all on show
We should be rockin' in the studio!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
Don't feel like working today, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
I feel like getting away, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
Don't feel like driving today, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh...
I feel like getting away
On my feet for a week, yeah, and nobody cares
And I can't get to sleep thinking nobody shares...

Are you talking to me? Get out of my way
We walk on the left and good manners are free,
You don't have to pay
You know you just can't see everything in a day
Yeah I'm talking to you
Yeah yeah yeah I know
