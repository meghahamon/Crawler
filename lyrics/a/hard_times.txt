The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

Yeah son, you know it's on
Now who would be the clown in the nine six
To mess around and catch a fist, I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me

Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, we're tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane? Is your brain intact?
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap

Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that, I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin' ill thoughts when I sleep at night, I gotta maintain
Blot the blood stains on my brain

From the clappin', we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin'
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin'
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin'
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someone's flippin' like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And I'ma maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown

I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke, I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin' to get up in this rap game
So I can gain some fame and build my crew's name

Rollin' with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations, brothas are tired of being broke
So maybe that's why they free basing, wastin' time doing nothing
Livin' like an outcast, gotta get up, get out and get something

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

Look into my eyes, see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin' on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin' out the underground

Takin' no prisoners, my listeners, we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin' field
Click, click, my mind's automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you wanna grab it

I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep, I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game, rappers act insane
Meanwhile, I'm blowin' the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain, son, elevate, try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
