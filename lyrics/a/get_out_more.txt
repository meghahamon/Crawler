She takes another hit
And left to deal with it
No use denying
And she won't listen, won't listen

He wants to be alone
But he's in every home
He's gotta settle down
She used to give a shit
And now she's eating it

And when her clothes don't fit
She won't listen, won't listen
He pulls her by her hair
He says it's 'cause he cares
They'll never settle down
They'll never settle down

She's looking for an easy way to get out
You know she's gotta get out more
She's looking for sugar in the snow
We keep on, keep on watching

He takes another shot
It turns him on a lot
She's everything he's not
He won't listen, won't listen

She's gonna sort it out
He's gonna stick around
They're gonna settle down
They're gonna settle down

She's looking for an easy way to get out
You know she's gotta get out more
She's looking for sugar in the snow
She keeps on, keeps on

She's looking for an easy way to get out
You know she's gotta get out more
She's looking for sugar in the snow
We keep on, keep on

She's looking for an easy way to get out
You know she's gotta get out more
She's looking for sugar in the snow
She keeps on, keeps on

She's looking for an easy way to get out
You know she's gotta get out more
She's looking for sugar in the snow
We keep on, keep on watching
