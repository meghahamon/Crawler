When it rains in monterey 
Reminds me of the choice I made 
Make the winter easier to bear 
Got the news of santa cruz 
When all you got you got to lose 
Christmas day and no one seems to care 

Don't waste your time 
Don't lose your mind 

It's funny how the weather smells 
When all the folks are doing well 
Spreading all the sunshine all around 
Don't know oceanography 
But that's the spot to bury me 
When my winter finally comes around 

Don't waste your time 
Don't lose your mind 

Don't waste your time 
Don't waste your time 
Don't waste your time
