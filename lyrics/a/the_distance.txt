We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah

Running out of luck, trying to keep it punk
You can only let yourself down
Afraid of what you know, a square shape in a round hole
You know, it goes in tight, it goes in tight

We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?

You're running out of time, you're never going nowhere
The best is all behind you
You're spending your cash like a man with no hands
Keepin' it real like your favorite bands
If they don't try then we don't buy, we don't buy

It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up, so stand up, so get up

We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?

(We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go)
It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up, so stand up, so get up
  (It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?)

It's the distance, it's the distance
  (We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go)
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up, so stand up, so get up, come on, come on
  (It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?)

We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?
