It's a badly calculated move
When you think we feel we need to prove
That we paid our ****ing dues
Well, you're the one that's ****ing new
You'd know if you'd ever spent a day
That these things don't ****ing go away
You can see our contract says
That we get to do this our own way

You can't tell us what to do..don't be punks
You can't tell us where to go.. don't be punks
