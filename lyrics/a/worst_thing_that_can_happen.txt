Standing with a headache
I try to fight but I can't deny the pain
Reservations what I got
From the bottom to the top

On the bottle, 5 times a day
Standing with the top line
You know it's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm shaking and I feel so alive

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen to you?

When there's nothing on
You find yourself caught in the spotlight
You try to fight but you can't delight the phase
On your knees is what you're not

Keeping what you got
Don't try to hide your face, caught in a flashlight
You know it's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm breaking and I feel so alive

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen to you?

When there's nothing right
When there's nothing right

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen to you?
