Your secret voices
Know what I won't forget
I can fight only seeing my tracks
There's nothing the same

This is my pale horse
This is my gold digger

Great white consuming
take me in your arms
In your arms
Great giver of mercy
Surround me with your presence
With your presence
But I can feel your arms around me
Your unconditional love
It's how you speak
It's where you find me
Now bring me to my knees
He will never forsakeâ€¦.
You, I will never forsake you
You, so here I come
Here I come

You think your alone
You're not alone

Wake up I am coming to you
Wake up I am coming
