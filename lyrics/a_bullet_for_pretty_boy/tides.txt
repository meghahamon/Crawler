We've been here for far too long
We turn our backs
When we know that you are always there
We've been here before
It's far too similar
We continue to choose
To turn our back
It's not easy being strong
It's not easy
We've let this fade
Like a tide washing away
There is something inside us
That we cant create
We have to fight to be strong
We have to be strong to fight
The battle isn't over
And the war has just begun
What is it that we need
Something to fill this void
This is the beginning
