No more sneaking through life,
it's like a sickness we all have.
like a cancer eating away,
like a fire burning our flesh
It's the pain we feel
that stains our surface

I've been running in circles
trying to figure out how to shed this skin.

I've hid these problems for far too long,
I need to face reality.
God take this and make it yours,
I can't do this on my own
I'm my own worst enemy

Ripping apart my world,
shattering so-called dreams.
It's time to take charge
It's time to make a change
Pick me up the floor
I can't do this on my own.

I've been running in circles
trying to figure out how to shed this skin.

I am yours.

No more hiding in the darkness,
No more cheating yourself.
No more hiding in the darkness,
no more kidding yourself.

No more hiding in the darkness,
No more kidding ourselves.
