The head rush here's
Total
Smoke and mirror
Provocation
While the old ropes crack
Respect's long hung
Cursed with the flickers
Of forked tongues

Can't say you didn't know well
What could come
Ain't no just can't tell

Sold baited rags
Cold cut to choke on
The filth and the fury's
Within us all
While sad grey flags
Fly for no one I know of
We dance on the water
Like skippin' stones

Sometimes you never can tell
What could come
Sometimes it's just as well

'cause if it's all written
Don't mean I'm done dreamin'
For more than grey shades and bitter pills
Of rage in our hearts
Dust in the wind
