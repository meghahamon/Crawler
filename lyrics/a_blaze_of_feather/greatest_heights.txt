All of this
Lost
All of this
One
All of this
Glorious tragedy
Forgotten done
All of this
Ours
All of this
Gone
All of this
Mindblowin' majesty
Yours to know

Oh, little one
I wish I could ease your time
From the sorrow that you know well
But there must come a time
In the dark before the light
When the shadows run again

And the sadness that you feel
The emptiness of years
They are companions on the road ahead
For without these fallen tears
Could you know joys sweetness?
They are all hands we need to hold

All of this
Lost
All of this
One
All of this
Glorious tragedy
Forgotten done
All of this
Ours
All of this
Gone
All of this
Mindblowin' majesty
Yours to know

From greatest heights we shall fall
None the wiser to it all
And in time we stumble
Crackin' skulls and scaling walls
And by design, designed to fall
Against the grain been raised and rolled
But my old heart for all its flaws
Still believes in miracles

From greatest heights we shall fall
None the wiser to it all
And in time we stumble
Crackin' skulls and scaling walls
And by design, designed to fall
Against the grain been raised and rolled
But my old heart for all its flaws
Still believes in miracles

Push it all out
Let the pain go
I know you mean to be strong
But you're barely holdin' on
Let yourself down gently
Let it all go
Embrace the strange light in the sky
As the turbulence subsides

Push it all out
Let the pain go
I know you mean to be strong
But you're barely holdin' on
Let yourself down gently
Let it all go
Embrace the strange light in the sky
As the turbulence subsides

Push it all out
Let the pain go
I know you mean to be strong
But you're barely holdin' on
Let yourself down gently
Let it all go
Embrace the strange light in the sky
As the turbulence subsides

Push it all out
Let the pain go
I know you mean to be strong
But you're barely holdin' on
Let yourself down gently
Let it all go
Embrace the strange light in the sky
As the turbulence subsides
