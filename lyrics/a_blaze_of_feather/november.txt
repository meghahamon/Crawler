Cold November called in to the ol' towns
All bitter breath from The Man
Felt like runnin' while I'm able
Can't lose my head now
So sick of all the poison
Shudder at the sound

May we all still love Humans
Ma what's going on
We fell though cracks, widening
These mountains we're now carrying
We were all meant to climb
Can't just lay down
Leave hope to fate
Maybe this is unreal?

Caught my reflection in broken glass
Thought of children and questions
And their dreams yet to have
My heart knows pressure
To be some kind of man
This cold hearted rain
Keeps widening the cracks

Maybe we are still half-Human
Never walk, we run
De-railed from tracks, keeps climbing
This hatred carving canyons
Need to find our way out
From the worst of past
Too much at stake

Where's our minds at?
Feels like common decency
Is too much to ask these days
While we're all talking around answers
All our hearts beat the same
And no-one still said no more
At least not in our name

We all felt the shame at November
This cold hearted rain in November
Felt the hard rain that November
This cold hearted rain in November
We all felt the shame at November
