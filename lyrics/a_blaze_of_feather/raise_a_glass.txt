Raise a glass, raise another
One to ourselves, one to the others
Times like these, they are sweet
And oh my friends, I hope you see that
We'll never be this young again
No we'll never be this young again
And no matter how we try to hold on to life
No we'll never be this young again
Raise a glass, raise another
One to our past and to what we'll discover
The days pass by, a blur in time
So get it in your head, and keep in mind that
We'll never be this young again
No we'll never be this young again
And no matter how we try to hold on to life
No we'll never be this young again
Days, they come and go
Most will fade away in time
Days, they come and go
Most will fade away, but not today
Raise a glass, raise another
One to our health and one to my mother
The best ones go, before their time
Life can be a storm, but you can shine
We'll never be this young again
No we'll never be this young again
And no matter how we try to hold on to life
No we'll never be this young again
