Why should we care about what other people think
All it does is make our hearts sink
I know as Christians we are set apart
I know you want to be cool but listen to your heart
God doesn't care what other people think of Him
He stands with open arms even if you don't believe in Him
He's always there so don't be afraid
Just open up your heart and let Him in
Jesus came down to free us from sin
How can someone sleep without Him tucking you in
Life is life yeah you know it
Another cool hat won't help it
All you need is a spot for God to sit
Just be cool that's all that matters
Why are you trying to please everyone else
Don't do that if you can't even please yourself
I don't want to be a trend setter
I want to live like Jesus did
