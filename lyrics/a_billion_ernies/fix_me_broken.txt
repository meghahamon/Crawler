It's hard to explain the truth when no one's there to listen to you
it's hard to describe the way I see the world is treating you
it's hard to believe the promise Jesus gave means so little to you
it's hard to feel God's love when hate and lies overwhelm truth
train my eyes to see only you but my hands still cling to life
find my hope in one or the world know only one can be claimed as true
please God fix me broken
give up hating
give lying one world filled up
give up hating
give up lying this worlds
full enough the beauty of the world is only skin deep guilded with gold,
but rotten enderneath
