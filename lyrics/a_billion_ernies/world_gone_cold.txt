Watching from the rock of life where I can see the world afar
It's all burnt up from the Devil's evil charm
The world needed help
God knows who to send
He sends His only son
You better get ready for the end
Why are you running from the God of Light
Can't you see the streets of gold or is your heart froze up frozen up
It's just too cold only one man can warm it up
Take his cup drink it up He is coming coming from above
Coming if you are ready or not
Every tongue confess that Jesus is the risen one perfect in every manner Bright white the lamb of God
He's got all the answers
Are your eyes set for Zion
