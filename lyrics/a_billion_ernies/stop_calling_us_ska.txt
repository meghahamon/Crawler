Stop Calling Us Ska
Stop calling us ska.
dont stuff us in your box
And set it on fire.
Its taken me three years to realize
Its such a hateful genre.
If I sing about love I dont fit in
If I sing about God I am not wanted
Whatever happened to unity?
Yeah, thats what the sweet checks
On your vans symbolize.
It makes me sick, it feels like torture
every time I hear someone say
ska ska ska!
You never listened
You never cared
You sing a happy song because youre scared.
Oh no, I said God and its not a joke.
I guess Im shoving this right down your throat
Dont say that.
Dont say im ruining this style of music
When youre the culprit.
Since when is it ska to reject those
Who dont fit in?
Im sorry I sing about my God
And not how stupid jocks are.
Dont get me wrong I love the music
I love the upbeat and what skas supposed to be.
I just hate the scene nowadays its so fake
They hate you if they disagree with what you say.
Every time I think about it
I want to write a letter to every ska band
Tell them ska is dead.
