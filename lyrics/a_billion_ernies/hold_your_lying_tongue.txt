Take a long look around
Think who can I talk about sin overcomes and the lies come pouring out
This wretched river of ignorance
Birds all in the way
The more water you create
The more trouble you make
The sky is falling down
The hole is now much deeper
You try to dig it out but the rain comes pouring down
Try to think before you act think before you talk
Don't do it for me but do it for God
Don't you know you hurt Him
It's like stabbing Him in the back
Just try not to lie that's a start
I cry out to God with this one prayer
Please God make the world better
All the lies and gossip they must stop
Hold your lying tongue
