Ring around my soul
Pocket full of pain posies
My search for freedom continues but to no avail
The sloth breathes it not I
He sits atop a tree with his crown and scepter surveying his domain
His glorious terrible domain who am I
You ask Martha Stewart in her car minding her own business
A ferret jumps on her face tearing at her flesh
Not able to see the road she crashes into a lime tree
I am that lime tree
Show me a sloth I'll show you a log
Where am I in the river of strife as are we all floating on a log
Struggling to breathe the air of truth
Get off the log get on the jet ski and ride it to light speed
Captain freedom you want to know the truth
Dig deep deeper you hit the water pipe and truth sprays out
