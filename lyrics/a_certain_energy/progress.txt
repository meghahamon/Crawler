Progress
Progress

Whoa man
What's your game plan
Why be patient
Ball man gotta ball man like you're Naismith
They said you're the savior
You're the haven
Well then
I guess I gotta be myself then
Fourth quarter in the makin'
Put in overtime on the overdrive
Never satisfied till the paradise
Keep it movin' even paralyzed
All of the hate better minimize
Put in the work like a nine to five
Never waitin' till the day I die
For a better life to be recognized
This is the moment of truth
This is the life that I choose
This is for real
Always been payin' my dues
Soon I will have nothin' to lose
I will prevail
Even if I get derailed
I can feel my moment comin' like it was in braille
This is my holy grail goin' for overkill
Not on my level so never compare
And never be generous all of it's earned and I know you feel envious
This life is so strenuous any connection can end up be venomous
I feel like a veteran to these degenerates
Feel like the genesis
I do this so effortless even my enemies become confederate
God, feel like it's all a mirage
Put the struggle on a pause can I get props
Can the boy get an applause
Nobody tell him to stop
Rockin' that old school like it's Motown
Hands up like a touchdown
I'm gonna finesse
Even if no one's impressed
Nothing but progress on God
