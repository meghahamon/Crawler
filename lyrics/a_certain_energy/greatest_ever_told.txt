Y'all niggas rather be more famous than rich
I ain't never live my life tryin' to be famous
At all
I don't give a fuck about that shit
We tryin' to get this motherfucking money
Stack these coins
Motherfucking
My momma gotta motherfucking gamble
Every week
That's what the fuck she wanna do

Drivin' in that foreign
That's that shit I want the most (most)
I just want a comma after comma
And some more shit (more shit)
None of this is brand new
I just wanna let you know man (know man)
Bouta be the greatest story that is ever told yeah
Drivin' in that foreign
That's that shit I want the most (most)
I just want a comma after comma
And some more shit (more shit)
None of this is brand new
I just wanna let you know man (know man)
Bouta be the greatest story that is ever told yeah (ever told yeah)

No you and I don't associate
My city gon' back me like vertebrates
From what they gon' calculate
I gotta implicate paperweights
For all the moves I make (damn)
They say the game gotta get renovated
So I'm nominated for the obligation
So it's resonated with this generation
Once I'm pullin' up
There is a detonation
Lynching these rappers
They calling me Marshawn
There's no point to respond
Claimed as amazin'
I gotta be patient to be dawned the greatest
I'm harder than pavement
They say I'm the shit what a hell of a fragrance
They say I'm complacent with statements
Complainin'
But this is my claimant I'm paintin' (damn)
Think of this as an invasion
With implication to be innovated
This is entertainin' with their irritation
Middle fingers up no lubrication
Hatin' the lyrical pollination
Prophecy states I'm the revelation
There's no speculation of a replication
In the population so I'm gonna take it
Nobody wanna fuck with me when I'm in the zone
Writin' like Cauldron
Man I gotta get it all on my own
Everything that I propose to condone
Just to let it be known
All of it's critical
There is no minimal
This is the stepping stone to get the throne

Drivin' in that foreign
That's that shit I want the most (most)
I just want a comma after comma
And some more shit (more shit)
None of this is brand new
I just wanna let you know man (know man)
Bouta be the greatest story that is ever told yeah
Drivin' in that foreign
That's that shit I want the most (most)
I just want a comma after comma
And some more shit (more shit)
None of this is brand new

Drivin' in that foreign
Dri-Dri-Drivin' in that foreign
Drivin' in that foreign
Dri-Dri-Drivin' in that
In that foreign
Drivin' in that foreign
Dri-Dri-Drivin' in that foreign
Drivin' in that foreign
Dri-Dri-Drivin' in that
