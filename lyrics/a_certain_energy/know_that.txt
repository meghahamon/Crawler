I just wanna make a hundred million
Do y'all know that
I just wanna be the greatest of all
Do y'all know that
Make it a livin' just killin' err one of y'all
Do y'all know that
I just gotta keep it rollin'
Gotta keep it poppin' till the coffin' drops dog
I be doin' this

Pray the lord I'm gonna make it
All I wanna be is famous
I don't care about the haters
All they do is make me greater
The prodigy piling with energy
Aim at my enemies that is the recipe
Do what I gotta do
Nothing is optional
This is the start of a dynasty
Better just get with the program
In love with success what a romance
Be runnin' this shit through the motions
Don't be actin' brand new you're a has been
Seein' right through you, translucent
Always irrelevant, nuisance
Whatchu know about the man now
How 'bout stand down
Or you'll end up a man down

I just wanna make a hundred million
Do y'all know that
I just wanna be the greatest of all
Do y'all know that
Make it a livin' just killin' err one of y'all
Do y'all know that
I just gotta keep it rollin'
Gotta keep it poppin' till the coffin' drops dog
I be doin' this

I am the reason it's hot in the summer
I'm breaking degrees while you sit there and wonder
Nocturnal being while you go recover
Like Khaled with dubs all I want is another
All of my lyrics are bandoliers
I'm aiming at people that never cared
Just know it's my moment be well aware
Like I said I am hot like a solar flare
Oh my god I swear to god comparing to me there is none
You say you put in the work, but I do not see anything done
My dosage like morphine, I am the feeling that everyone wants
Based on the income I really came up
And now I got the cheddar, but it's not enough
Dimelo if you gon' hate now
I am like Mack on the third down
Flex around hate
If that's what it takes
For all of y'all to recognize real now
You're not successful
You are hysterical
Looks like the type that be needin' a miracle
You are irrelevant
Never a variable
You are the one that be doin' your interviews

I just wanna make a hundred million
Do y'all know that
I just wanna be the greatest of all
Do y'all know that
Make it a livin' just killin' err one of y'all
Do y'all know that
I just gotta keep it rollin'
Gotta keep it poppin' till the coffin' drops dog
I be doin' this
