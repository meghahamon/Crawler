They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my
They're praying for my

They're praying for my downfall
They don't know me
Say they're there but they never were my homies
Praying for my downfall
I'm the problem
Cut him off is the only way to stop him
Praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall

I know I told myself that I would make it out
Even with the doubt I kept it flowing like it's bleeding out
I mean
Ventilators couldn't even help breathe
They say they can't wait to see the day I finally RIP
I gotta keep it steady, so I'm talkin' monotone
Always gotta put in work, so no it's never optional
Shit ain't what it used to be, I made it seem morepossible
Yeah I got the mightest touch, somethin' that you oughta know
I ain't on the standby list, so I ain't gotta wait for this
I am on a higher ground, somethin' you can never miss
Everybodies trippin' now
Must of lost their patience
Can't compare to the obtuse, so how the hell are we adjacent
And I know, they ain't got the means to have this
Income turns to outcome then they askin' how it happened
I ain't gonna lie to you the grind is never magic
Damn near bleeded out to have my income be expanded

They're praying for my downfall
They don't know me
Say they're there but they never were my homies
Praying for my downfall
I'm the problem
Cut him off is the only way to stop him
Praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall

Like I said I feel like I'm on life support
But that doesn't mean I'm cool with letting nature take it's course
I ain't with that waiting game
I ain't nothing like before
I am always steady sold out while you're stuck up in the stores
I'm close to reaching pinnacle, you're barely hitting minimal
I'm sick with it, I'm clinical
You make it look so difficult
This ain't me just talkin' dog, I know I'm being literal
This a one way street to me I must've been the centerfold
This the way I gotta be, had one hell of an odyssey
No one for hypocrisy, so I'm the one you gotta see
And I ain't never frontin' dog, this the life I'm made for
And Ima keep on going hard, there's no such thing as safe words
This is not a fairy tale, this a life they die for
Never satisfied for when I get some I just want more
I know I am the man that's on demand
No matter how you take your stance you better undersand

They're praying for my downfall
They don't know me
Say they're there but they never were my homies
Praying for my downfall
I'm the problem
Cut him off is the only way to stop him
Praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
They're praying for my downfall
