I've been on a roll now
I've been on a roll now
I've been on a roll now

I've been on a roll now foot is on the pedal (pedal)
I've been makin' moves now
Talkin' to the devil (devil)
Why settle in the middle
If I reach the full potential (potential)
I don't need your help man
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself

Concentration towards my declaration
Gotta make a statement gotta go
Gotta make it on my own
And I don't just wanna be locally known
Universal while I keep my circle
Always grinding with a sense of purpose
When conducting business
Rather be in person just so I see that it's worth it
This is me always been prideful
To the future I'm insightful
Even if nobody listens
I put in the minutes
Like Kobe in '06
And nobodies fucking with my clique
Never giving y'all the right to stay
Like I control the terrain
I'm never giving y'all the night and day
I've been grinding from the jump
And I'm feeling like Obi Wan
The only hope everyone's looking for
Hoping that I am the one that is in control
But this life is so crazy
All of the struggle has made me
Been thinkin' that lately
Even if everyone hates me
Setting the tone
Writing these lyrics in stone
Always been down
Like I've been staying on prone
Anyone hearing me out
These are the words to be known
Anyone hearing me out
These are the words to be known yeah

I've been on a roll now foot is on the pedal (pedal)
I've been makin' moves now
Talkin' to the devil (devil)
Why settle in the middle
If I reach the full potential (potential)
I don't need your help man
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself

Always levels to this shit
Never am I to give portions
You either live it or don't
Nothing else should be important
I grew to this shit I'm about it
Even with all of my problems
It's the mentality to live it lavishly
Fuck with me end up a casualty yeah
Tell me who really gon' topple me
I've been thinkin' bout my odyssey
All of the shit I've been through wasn't easy
I don't see nobody stoppin' me
The grind has always been a part of me
Everybody wantin' hand outs
Yet everybody scared to stand out
Ghost writin' like a pen pal
Y'all don't get it what I do it for
Point out pretenders like decimals
That's all I can see with my retinols
I kept it one hundred like centennials
And shout out to all of my enemies
Cus once I do make it
It's rest in peace
That's rest in peace so the hate will cease
And then the whole city gon' want me
Such an insomniac
But really I never want sleep
Stack all the coins and never miss an opportunity
And everybody want a bottle
Everybody wanna follow
Everybody has their poisons
Cut them off like it's the gallows

I've been on a roll now foot is on the pedal (pedal)
I've been makin' moves now
Talkin' to the devil (devil)
Why settle in the middle
If I reach the full potential (potential)
I don't need your help man
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself

This shit ain't for everybody ima get it for myself
This shit ain't for everybody
I-I-I-I-I

I've been on a roll now foot is on the pedal (pedal)
I've been makin' moves now
Talkin' to the devil (devil)
Why settle in the middle
If I reach the full potential (potential)
I don't need your help man
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself (for myself)
For myself (for myself)
For myself
This shit ain't for everybody
Ima get it for myself
