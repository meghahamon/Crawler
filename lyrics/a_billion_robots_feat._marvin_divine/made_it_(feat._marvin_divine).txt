Let's go
(Oh Yea... Wo!)
Heh!
I've been feelin' like I made it
Heh!
And I ain't really famous
I just work long nights on my own
Ended up in LA with the squad (???)
Heh!
Show those drinks in the air now
(???) got me shedding tears now
Man, i wish my grandma was here now
Heh!
'Cause I'm the man of the inn now
(drop)
I got left by girls I really loved
I felt like I just wasn't enough
And that led to me just getting drunk
Thinking I was tough by fighting in the club
My friends could see that I was stressed out
The music seen had me left out
We all knew I could be the best out
So I had to move and forget about
All the things that ever broke me
'Cause really they ain't really never break me
'Cause I'm right here talking to ya
So if anything they had to made me
The life I live now is crazy
Noone thought this would happen
Bright lights, cameras flashing, show me the rabbit this must be magic
So if you have a dream, better chase it
Write it on your heart, don't let nobody erase it
Have it on your arm, like a mother and her bracelet
And get so close you can taste it
Show those drinks in the air now
(???) got me shedding tears now
Man, I wish my grandma was here now
'Cause I'm the man of the inn now!
