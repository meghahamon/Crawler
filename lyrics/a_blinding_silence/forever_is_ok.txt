Believe forever's ok
Do not fear the hands of time no, do not run away
I promise that I'll love you forever and a day
even when the sun falls from the sky
you'll light my way

Just you

I will be there come what may
even should the mountains crumble away
do not fear that time will ever drown you in her wake
even should the world fall to the sea I'd keep you safe

Just you

Who are we anyways, to interfere with fate?
Forever will be ok
