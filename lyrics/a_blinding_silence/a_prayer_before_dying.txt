I say a prayer for you in this failing final hour.
he wants to take you home.
just say a prayer for me and smile in my defeat
and live to suffer this no more.

I celebrate in the light of you
breathed life from you, I fall apart without you
what can I do? it is burning inside you
I say a prayer for you, what will I do without you?
what more can I do? it is burning inside you.
I say a prayer for you. it is burning inside you.
tell me what to do. it is burning inside you.

Just tell me what to do in this fading final hour
before you have to go
just say a prayer for me, a sand upon the sea
I'm hearing angels at the door

I celebrate in the light of you
breathed life from you, I fall apart without you
what can I do? it is burning inside you
I say a prayer for you, what will I do without you?
what more can I do? it is burning inside you.
I say a prayer for you. it is burning inside you.
tell me what to do. it is burning inside you.
