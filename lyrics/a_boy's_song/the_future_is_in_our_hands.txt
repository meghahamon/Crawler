Space and the time are their big weapons
there is no place you can go and come back
Tomorrow is the promise of my past for die
hopefully no just a future
I travel in search of my old self last
The sky lights glow around of my campfire
An endless period where I lost me find
The sun will never return to the moon
Space and the time are their big weapons
there is no place you can go and come back
Space and the time are their big weapons
there is no place you can go and come back
Tomorrow is the promise of my past for die
hopefully no just a future
I travel in search of my old self last
The sky lights glow around of my campfire
An endless period where I lost me find
The sun will never return to the moon
You are the chosen oh!
The gift will be yours
And close the eyes
eh eh eh eh eh
I travel in search of my old self last
The sky lights glow around of my campfire
An endless period where I lost me find
The sun will never return to the moon
