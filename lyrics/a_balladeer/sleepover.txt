what do you think
of course I'm fine
with your little trip to the countryside
everything here is under control
I made my own plans for the weekend
all turkey cold

you do the drinking
go get lost
and I'll do the thinking
for the both of us

what do you think
of course I care
that you're with him out there
slamming vodka, beer or wine
alle Menschen werden Br√ºder
within a pair of pints

you do the drinking
go get lost
and I'll do the thinking
for the both of us

this is where you come in
and drop your bags
and throw your arms around my legs

you do the drinking
go get lost
and I'll do the thinking
for the both of us
