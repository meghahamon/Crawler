there was this long-haired girl down in Texas
she had a mission to convert my mind
she bought a Bible meant as a present
in which she wrote down and underlined:

"see, in Him there is no darkness"

He is light!
He is light!
He is light!

Jesus doesn't love me, but that's alright

there was this knock-out girl in my hometown
she had a tumor all round her spine
she had a funny walk that she hated
but I was proud of calling her mine

"see, in Him there is no darkness"

He is light!
He is light!
He is light!

Jesus doesn't love me, but that's alright

HALLELUJAH

there was this sicker girl on these pain drugs
her wish for a child was taken too fast
she died at Red Cross Hospital smiling
she beat her Pac-Man cancer at last

in the Kingdom of the Darkness

I am light!
I am light!
I am light!

Jesus doesn't love me, but that's alright

I love life
