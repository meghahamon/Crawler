you see, I have this picture, all perfect and pretty
in which all is all that it seems
with a white picket fence home away from the city
to live the American Dream

and it's you girl
that I see beside me
it's you girl
you're still on my mind

and it's you girl that I see beside me in time

how I long for the 50's in all of its glory
when Dean was the man and Monroe always smiled
I know life ain't a movie, no dime novel story
but I go for either the truth or a lie

and it's you girl that I see beside me
it's you girl you're still on my mind
and it's you girl that I see beside me in time

so many boys are so damn close to perfect
so many boys so much funner than me
but I'll try my hardest to make us so happy
so just like the good Lord meant it to be

and it's you girl
that I see beside me
it's you girl
I stare myself blind

and it's you girl that I see beside me in time

and it's you girl
that I see beside me
it's you girl
I know my own mind

and it's you girl all of the time

all of the time
