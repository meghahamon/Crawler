our fireworks at New Year were the bomb
the fun was short in a bar miles further on
the drama it was all over the news

I was up watching from the couch all night
with no one there to tell me it was gonna be alright
where were you when all hell broke loose

just a few disasters later
it doesn't take that much to see
it's been a good year for the papers
a bad one for me

W. says it's now an eye for an eye
Queen B. thinks that soon we'll all turn blind
me I'm just scared that we ain't seen nothing yet

just a few disasters later
it doesn't take that much to see
it's been a good year for the papers
a bad one for me
