the rain pours down in sheets
and the sky is gray
the sun just won't come out
and it's been like this for days

what if Noah had been here
and said he spoke to God
what if Noah had been here
to warn about the flood

now I'm a disbeliever
but he just might be right
it has rained and poured before
forty days and forty nights

what if Noah had been here
and said he spoke to God
what if Noah had been here
to warn about the flood

Noah did like God commanded
and built a gopher wooden ark
God said He'd wipe away the earth
as He had made it -

no one cared to hark

one pair of each creature
invited high and dry
both male and female
so that they could multiply

well, if Noah had been here
I would kick him in the shin
cause if Noah had been here
he just would not let me in
