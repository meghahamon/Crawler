I heard you came to visit
with real long blond hair
you appeared through a hole in the wall
on a night she wasn't there

she finds it hard without you
today I heard her say
she's afraid her stomach ache
might never go away

well

would you please come down here
just to see if she's alright
would you please come down here
for Isabelle tonight

that time she came to visit
you were weak but strong
you told her that she could be sad
but she couldn't grieve too long

I think she'd like to tell you
she's done the best she can
and last week on Queen's Day
she sort of ran into Diane

well

would you please come down here
just to see if she's alright
would you please come down here
for Isabelle tonight
