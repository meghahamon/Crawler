I miss the little boy I was
with shiny hair and starry eyes
and an oh so much stronger heart
and my mother's love

the backyard wasn't big enough
the world all full of surprises
that I wanted to be part of

so I put on his smile
just once again
dress up to the nines
without a chance
I close my eyes
and count to ten

and eleven

candle wishes don't come true
the fallen stars I called upon
might have been somebody else's
but now what's the harm in me still trying

it takes a fool to fill my shoes
I'm number one in cut and run
the milk is spilled
it's no use crying

so I put on a smile
just once again
dressed up to the nines
without a chance
I close my eyes
and count to ten

then eleven
