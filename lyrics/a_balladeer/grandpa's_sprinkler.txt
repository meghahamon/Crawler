the house hasn't changed over all the years
but it's been awhile since I've seen
the sky this blue
the grass just as green

cute and so blond in our bathing suits
on a late-summer lawn
he'd walk to the garage
and the sprinkler went on

and we'd skip
and we'd run
and we'd jump here
and we'd leap-frog and spin
and he'd smile
while we'd sing
at the pump here
until mom called us back in

gran steps outside with a walking stick
she has sure gotten old
we'll remember her from
that time before he turned cold

and we'd skip
and we'd run
and we'd jump here
and we'd leap-frog and spin
and he'd smile
while we'd sing
at the pump here
until mom called us in

and so life goes on and on

the girls in the grass feel just as at home
one dares me with these big blue eyes
so I chase her around
and throw her up to the sky
