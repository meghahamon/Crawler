she lost all her hair
but she still is in there
exactly like Isabelle said
they've painted her nails
all good promises fail
and quickly my eyes turn red

she says:

thank you for coming here
you're a real good friend
too bad we haven't been lovers

and I say:

go make the bed

her pain is severe
I just smile through my tears
and tell her that I understand
she thought it all through
so what else can I do
but quietly hold her hand

she says:

thank you for coming here
you're a real good friend
too bad we haven't been lovers

and I say:

you go ahead and make the bed
