Jamie, why are you so sad?
you say you don't feel anything
only every now and then
but it stops there, in your skin

Jamie, why are you so sad?
you just don't seem the crying kind
after playing with yourself -
you don't mind drawing those blinds

Jamie, why are you so sad?

is it really all that bad?
is it really all that bad?
Jamie, won't you look at me
and tell me, why you are so sad?

Jamie, why are you so sad?
how come you won't let him in?
him and everybody else
did you spread yourself too thin?

is it really all that bad?
is it really all that bad?
Jamie, won't you look at me
and tell me, why you are so sad?

Jamie, why are you so sad?
you say you don't feel anything
but you've been crying
and that's something to begin with

now ain't that something to begin with?
