alright, Mr. DeMille, Iâ€™m ready for my close-up
I've been steady out of focus now for long enough
don't talk about my heyday being way, way over
just a touch of make-up here and I'm off

I'm gonna be loved
I'm gonna be loved

L.O.V.E.D.

you fake it till you make it and you fake it some more then
a thing Monroe's a pretty good example of
in front of Miller and DiMaggio and millions of men
she ate her cake and she got stuffed

I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved

it's my way or no way
or else I just won't play
but I need direction
a bit of direction
set clear and everyone quiet, please
camera, lights and action!

it was too late to be selected as a Brat Pack actor
thank God for Missy Moore I never got the job
I could have beat her ass easy at a weeping contest
now the gloves are coming off because

I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved

it's my way or no way
or else I just won't play
but I need direction
a bit of direction
set clear and everyone quiet, please
camera, lights and action!
