let the sun go down unnoticed
let the clouds prepare to pour
let a pebble hail take over
let the water flow ashore

killer storm

make the wind go shake the houses
where it's cozy, nice and warm
hurt the elder's ears with thunder
scare the orphans in the dorms

killer storm

strike the cattle in the meadows
make the frogs come down in swarms
keep the lifeboats from the harbors
and the sailors far offshore

killer storm

for the fall-out
for the brawlers
for the bribes
for the wars that won't be won
for the Bible or the big bang
for really every gun that's gone off
for the Fathers under cover
for their struggle while â€˜loving' others' sons
for the con men
for the weak hand
for all of the above

what the world needs now ain't love

make the only few survivors
gaze at rainbows galore
when they're crying out to Jesus
hand the land back to their Lord

killer storm
