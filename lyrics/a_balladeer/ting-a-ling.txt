So here we are all stuck between
 These Fire Island men of means
 You must believe me when I say
 I like you, Jimmy Dean

 Let's take that Spyder for a ride
 Please, don't say you came by bike
 I know a game that we could play
 And it goes like

 Ting-a-ling

 They are not very hard to please
 All swishy-swashy, ma√Ætre d's
 See what them Brackett boys can do
 For you
 For me

 Us users kiss a lot of rear
 But look at them, those leering queers
 They have no clue we see right through
 Let's get out of here to

 Ting-a-ling

 You're not the brightest but you're right
 Why go through life with one hand tied
 Behind this back of mine

 Drive, just drive

 Let's get out of here
 There is so much out there
 We are not the only ones
