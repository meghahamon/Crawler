put yourself in my hands
it'll all be okay
a small step for man
and a same leap of faith

so take the fall
I'll have your back
just cross your arms
now brace yourself
let good old gravity
take its course

if not for us then do it for love

there's always a way
through, around or out
at this stage of the game
there's no place for doubt

so take the fall
I'll have your back
just cross your arms
now brace yourself
let good old gravity
take its course

if not for us then do it for love
