You never were a beauty queen,
though
but mr Greenfeld paid you good,
where are you Bambi Woods?

You looked around the cowboy town
and put your head and pompoms down,
you had your share of Hollywood.
Where are you Bambi Woods?
Where are you, Bambi Woods?

No Dallas ain't a place to livwe,
let alone a place to raise a kid
so fuck your old neighbourhood.
where are you Bambi Woods?
where are you, Bambi Woods?

Now even if you blondes have more fun, you're all some kind of joke.
But you don't seem that dumb to me, did you know that Marilyn once spoke.

Were you alive in NYC
'Cause others say you O.D'd.
Even though you're gone for good,
God bless you Bambi Woods
God bless you Bambi Woods

Even though you're gone for good,
Bye bye now Bambi Woods
Bye bye now Bambi Woods
Bye bye now Bambi Woods
