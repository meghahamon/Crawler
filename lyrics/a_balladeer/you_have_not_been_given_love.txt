you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love

somehow your silence was part of your charm
your body and face showed no traces of scars
your problems did not set off any alarms
I loved you, I fought to win your arms

you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love

it hurt me to hear what your mother was not
she probably taught you what she had been taught
you say you were able to shake her off
the wish being father to the thought

you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love

so you take and you take all the love I got
and I keep on letting you hurt me a lot

you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love
you have not been given love
