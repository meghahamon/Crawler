So You Found Yourself A Lover

so you found yourself a lover
so you found yourself a friend
so you found your way to comfort back again

I sure love those moments with someone new
I do miss those moments alone with you

tell me

does he make you breakfast
does he make you laugh
does he make you feel good
like I do and have

I'm sure there's a fish there for me at sea
or some other spinster just like me

tell me something good will happen
someone good will make me laugh
tell me he or she won't leave me
like they always have

so you found yourself a lover
so you found yourself a friend
so you found out he's a keeper
so you go hold him then
