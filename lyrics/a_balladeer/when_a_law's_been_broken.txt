there's no ‘is', only ‘was', when a heart's been broken there's no faith, just a cross, when a heart's been broken

there are sins there are drugs, when a heart's been broken
there are cloaks
there are rugs, when a law's been broken
there are floods, no more straws, when a heart's been broken
there are flaws, many flaws, when a heart's been broken

oh, man

there is scorn
there is grudge, when a heart's been broken

I don't laugh just as much since my heart got broken
