Did you ever run into that snowman again?
Did you ever stop drinking to see if you can?
Did you ever find someone so harmless and free?
Don't you worry about me
Did you check out Berlin on a Saturday night?
Did you maybe go back with a bit of contrite?
Did you narrate what happened on May '33?
Don't you worry about me
What about me?
I am alright
Still holding on tight
To the pact with all my might
And you know me
No good with regret
No, I'm still not over it yet
Do you still bite your nails, put up fights with your hair?
Do you still use your smile a bit over-aware?
Do you still have those crazy, those bullshit ideas?
Don't you worry about me
What about me?
I am alright
Still holding on tight
To the pact with all my might
And you know me
No good with neglect
No, I'm still not over it yet
But enough about that
Did you ever wake up and get out of that phase?
Did you ever greet Spring after seizing the days?
Did you ever uncover all of your glee?
Don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me.
