when all else fails
there's always again
and no fool like an old fool
you fought, you did
but don't kid yourself, man
you'll always be just a lone wolf

beat a retreat quick
and go lick your wounds
as an exception to prove the rule
lamb in fur, look!
what a night
what a moon

every herd has its lone wolf
