all the clouds have silver linings
and don't block the sun too long
there's a saying that
a little rain never hurt no one

when I'm back from stormy weather
and the damage has been done
I tell myself
a little rain never hurt no one

no one

save your drama for your mama
mine says: "learn to rise above"
men who fear get hit as well
but I'm too scared of love

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
father says: "the best defense is a good offence"
so pacifists like me don't stand a chance

no chance

all the clouds have silver linings
and don't block the sun too long
there's a saying that
a little rain never hurt no one

I know how to count my blessings
that the better things in life are free
but I can't help but think
a little rain has never hurt no one but me
