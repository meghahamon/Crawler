You rave on about a car drive
Somewhere out in germany
You had dinner near some river
Like you can't get that with me

And it all sounds so familiar
I make sure to bite my tongue
It's done nothing else but trouble
Kind of like our song

And all because

All i wanted was
The best of both of us

This must be what robin felt like
Who'd have thought i'd fit his shoes
How i'd smirk inside your t-shirt
After he had called for you

I've been him in that hotel room
When i took it as a no
Now i'd rather be in hamburg
Putting up our breakfast show

And all because

All i wanted was
The best of both of us
All i wanted was

For us to get across
For things to be like then, out there on the road
For my mediocre jokes to work again

We can leave tonight â€“
I'll drive us past the wood
Just sit there being beautiful
While i'll be good

Hell, i'll be good

All i wanted
All i wanted was

I'm telling myself it's all for the better
