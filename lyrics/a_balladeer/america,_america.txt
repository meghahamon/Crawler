I wasn't even seventeen when I believed the grass was greener
where life is one big movie scene
of beauty queens and paper boy achievers

Wednesday nights at Mary’s house I tried to open up to Jesus
cause I had seen them raise their brows
to the only non-believer in

America, America

in an air-conditioned class I auditioned for Mrs. Townsend's choir
David wore a cowboy hat
he lip-synched like she ordered him

we prayed for soldiers in Iraq to give them strength to fire
we pledged allegiance to the flag
we praised our freedom caught between the borders of

America, America

Mary’s father brought us home
he drove us through the heart of Texas
once in Dallas I was shown
the spot where JFK got shot
