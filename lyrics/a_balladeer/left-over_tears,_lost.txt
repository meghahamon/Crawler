And here I am again
Crying
Back again
Trying to think clear
But it's hard to see straight
Through hasty heaping tears

Please, let these be left-over tears
Lost
These have to be left-over tears
They must...

And there you were again
Sitting
On my couch again
Hitting on my memories
It used to be too small
Now there's place enough for three

(at least)

Please, let these be left-over tears
Lost
These have to be left-over tears
They must...

These have to be left-over tears
They just must...
Please, let these be left-over tears
Lost

And there I am again
Swearing
