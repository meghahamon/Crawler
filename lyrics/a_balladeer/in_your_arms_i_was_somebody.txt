if there's one thing in life
that I've come to know
it's that we are all no one
when we are alone

mothers and Hollywood
and the good God up above
make it all seem so easy to love

my grandfather died
and he had his wife by his side
kissing his forehead

oh, mothers and Hollywood
and the good God up above
make it all seem so easy to love

in your arms I was somebody, somebody
in your arms I was somebody, somebody
somebody easy to love

mothers and Hollywood
and the good God up above
make it all seem so easy to love

in your arms I was somebody, somebody
in your arms I was somebody, somebody
somebody easy to love
