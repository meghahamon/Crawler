oh boy, we are foils in an ancient play
only an act away from hell to pay
you hate saving up for a rainy day
me, I like to keep the sun away

oh, we don't match, fit, blend, mix, stick, click

we're incompatible – you don't say, no

like an iron fist and a velvet glove
we are cut from a different cloth
a big hand for us co-existing moths
burning up in the flame of love

oh, we don't match, fit, blend, mix, stick, click

we're incompatible – you don't say, no

it's chemically decided love is blind
and so I don't know what hit me
let me fall into your arms for I am sure
that they are gonna fit me

though we're incompatible
