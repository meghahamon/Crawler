hail to the king and queen of Eden
taking life here as a breeze
it's hard to get out of the woods though
when one can not see the forest for the trees

I feel a change is in the air
we are heading for a storm
but we are not prepared
for rain or a wolf at the door

it is time to find us better shelter
for once, please be an easy touch
with a bag full of tricks
we must hit the bricks
and leave this little house of sticks
that can only take so much

because a change is in the air
we are heading for a storm
but we are not prepared
for rain or a wolf at the door

so let's get away
for soon we'll be prey
hunted and chased and slayed

know a change is in the air
we are heading for a storm
but we are not prepared
for rain or a wolf at the door
