I peek at you in secret
I ignore you just in time
I giggle like a schoolgirl
I convince you that I'm fine

I'd do anything and more to make you mine

I curse your taste in lovers
I judge your lack of spine
I put you down in public
I manipulate, malign

I'd do anything and more to make you mine

I don't want to make you feel bad, but it's true
there is no one who can make me feel this good

no one else but you

I'll stop giving signals
I'll start reading signs
I'll stop being selfish
I'll step back in line

but I'll sing you these love songs until you're mine
