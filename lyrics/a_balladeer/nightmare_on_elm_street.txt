he’d asked her to come to California where it’s even warmer than in Texas
he tells her twice to lose her glasses as they pass the masses on the streets
Jackie she sees what a lady is not supposed to see
Jackie she starts to scream and gets up on her knees

it’d been the perfect night for murder or so he said, the morning after
but he was mad for all she mattered - she took it lightly and let him be
Jackie she sees what a lady is not supposed to see
Jackie she starts to scream and gets up on her knees

when his head fell in her lap she then lost her state of grace
crimson red on pink Chanel
she will soon regret having washed her hands and face

Jackie she sees what a lady is not supposed to see
Jackie she starts to scream and gets up on her knees
Jackie she sees what a lady is not supposed to see

shot three

she leaves her seat in the heat on Elm Street
