this here is the perfect setting
for a justified embrace
and this goodbye's a good excuse
for me to kiss your face
it's in scenes like these I wonder
what it would be like
all alone with you
on a drunken night

yes, I know it's wrong
so I won't say
my tongue now is tied
and you know I won't stand
in your way
so I'll step aside

there's nowhere in the world now
I'd rather want to be
then in your arms
little humble, crumble me
but I am scared of what might happen
cause nothing ever should
yes, I know - I agree

friends is good
friends is good

and I know it's wrong
so I won't say
my tongue now is tied
and you know I won't stand
in your way
so I'll step aside

I'll step aside

if we could only choose the ones we love
