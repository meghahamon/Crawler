so welcome to Vegas
where lights are like stars
out in the desert
it's all sevens and bars
I'm over-aware that
a beggar can’t choose
so let’s place a bet fast
may the best man lose

watch the neon screaming for us dreamers
like some sort of an alarm
I will not pardon my demeanor
don't you dare now pinch my arm

the fruit here looks tempting
in every way
I'm a one-armed bandit
that waits to be played
I once took a gamble
then life took its toll
no, I’m not a winner
but I’m on a roll

watch the neon screaming for us dreamers
like some sort of an alarm
I will not pardon my demeanor
don't you dare now pinch my arm

ladies and gentlemen, place your bets now
don't put your money where your mouth is

welcome to Vegas
where lights are like stars
