hi - hi, it's me again
second time today
but this time with a plan

don't - don't be mad at me
I was hoping we could talk
and maybe flee

now the playground's closed
we can go someplace somewhere else
I could show you the smell and the sound
of fresh cut grass

so go get dressed

I - I respect your choice
yes, I read you
there's no need to raise your voice

go - go back inside
we don't want to wake the neighbors
or my Hyde

I'm so tired of being a saint all by myself
I guess you don't really know me all that well

but

I need help
I need help

to hell with these patterns and all those damn parallels
how come no one wants to know me all that well?

please, do tell

if â€“ if I slit my wrists
I would bleed to death
to show you I exist

don't - don't call the cops
just tell me you don't love me
and I'm off

well, I'll be off

but I'll be back
