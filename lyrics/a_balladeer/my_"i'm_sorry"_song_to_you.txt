so without a cloud in sight
you went and changed the mood
you longed for no one else
but asked for solitude

I begged, I stole, I borrowed
I stuck around like glue
this is my "I'm sorry" song to you

I nursed you through my tears
until you got immune
you turned your head to drink
I poured my heart out in tunes

then

when you drowned our sorrow
I was sad for two
this is my "I'm sorry" song to you

oh, I know I have cursed your name and God's
yeah, I know I held you off for far too long
but I lost all I got
because I never thought
there'd ever come a time
when your eyes and your heart would stop idolizing me

now

yesterday's tomorrow
way far overdue
this is my "I'm sorry" song to you

if -fill in- is the one
I'm still your number II
you're back with someone old
so I need someone new

this is nothing borrowed
this is something blue
this is my "I'm sorry" song to you

my "I'm sorry" song to you
