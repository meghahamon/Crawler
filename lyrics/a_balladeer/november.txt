it's hard in November
with the start of the cold
and weather making
hands look old

though it's hardly November
it is already here
but you don't seem
to blink an eye, my dear

there's no resisting the winter
nights will get longer and longer
and every bit of persistence
is only among the stronger

I'm dreading December
to hell with December
and all of its cheer
the most wonderful time of the year

sure, look away from this car crash
and call it a fender-bender
some things are nothing
when one is the pretender of pretenders

it's hard in November
with the start of the cold
and weather making
my hands look old

I'm dreading December
to hell with December
and all of its cheer
the most wonderful time of the year

sure, look away from this car crash
and call it a fender-bender
some things are nothing
when one is the pretender of pretenders

it's hard in November,

when December has ended
and fireworks explode
we'll hope for the better
knowing what we sowed

oh, what we sowed
