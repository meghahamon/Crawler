Just a perfect day (for this time of year)
We're making away with right in the rear
An indian summer sun, red

Berlin ahead

The sky so pretty through the open roof
And i so witty - your laughter, my proof
All your glee
Through your hand on my knee

The memory's alive tonight
The driver's seat feels quite alright
And i don't know what it is
But i think i could get used to this

The lamppost lights are a canopy of stars
But you on my right you light up the car
The road and me
Your hand on my knee

More on than off it distracts my pedal foot
As we fall in love with parachutes

Yeah, we do –
Yeah, we do

The memory's alive tonight
The driver's seat feels quite alright
And i don't know what it is
But i think i could get used to this

I am aware and sad somehow
This is here, this is now
How i love to be in this state we're in
Right before we take berlin

Before we take berlin

We’re moving too fast
Let’s take another five
I’d just like it to last
This six hour drive
A few hours more

Snacks and gas galore

The memory's alive tonight
The driver's seat feels quite alright
And i don't know what it is
But i think i could get used to this

I am aware and sad somehow
This is here, this is now
How i love to be in this state we're in
Right before we take berlin

Don't tell me you don't feel this, too
