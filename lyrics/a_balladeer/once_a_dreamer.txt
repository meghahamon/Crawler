I was this dreamer in advance
then life showed up in the middle of my plans
so maybe it was not the pact
it sure was good - the best in fact

I may say I have changed –

I have cried and sworn a lot
once it was gone I saw what I got
I reminisce more than I should
but I miss feeling special and looking good

I may say I have changed –
I sure have changed

and I do dream, it's just not the same
sometimes I think I really hate you
for the doubter I became
