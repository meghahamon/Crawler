you already have me
in the palm of your hand
when you promise you'll do
all in your power to
keep making me laugh

and you picture the lives
of the kids you and I
are going to have
in a house on a hill
that will not have been built
on sand

in never-never land
in never-never land

we squint our eyes in a rain of rice
and when you ask our guests to all raise their glasses
high to the sky
my head's on your chest for I am
drunk on you, love
drunk on you

and we dance and we dance to
the band
and not once you let go of my hand

in never-never land
