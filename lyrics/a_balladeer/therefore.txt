here I am once again, starting anew
and more than before I do not have a clue
how does one belong when not part of two
I miss us, and therefore you

there are railroads and bridges and high buildings too
glad I don't see the world with a black and white view
there are so many mind-blowing dark shades of blue
I miss us, baby, and therefore you

that love's for the lucky turned out to be true
you lose a few, you lose a few
still I admit that it's not the best thing to do
to miss us, and therefore you

despite all the fights and what you've put me through
am I right to say we had our good moments too
well, I guess till the day I find somebody new
I'll miss us, baby, and therefore you
