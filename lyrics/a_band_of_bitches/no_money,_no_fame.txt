I ain't got no money.
I ain't got no fame.

The only reason I keep trying
is cause you are such a shame.

You don't see I've been losing my mind
and I've been doing everything to make you mine.
(Mueve el cuerpo)
Time keeps fast and by
and Im getting younger, I'm just tired of try.

Why can't you go and make it right?
Why do I always start a fight?
Why can't we just embrace the fact
that we are wasting each other's time.

You have to make me happy, get a job and buy me something.
For a moment there I live
I assume you.
(Mueve el cuerpo)
Somewhere in the world that ride the pity is not the one I want to.
Why can't you go and make it right?
Why do I always start a fight?
Why can't we just embrace the fact
that we are wasting each other's time.
