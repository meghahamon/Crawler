A band of bitches stole my car
a band of bitches crushed my house
a band of bitches broke my heart
they disappeared and left me

I can't tell, I can't tell
was it my mistake?
I don't know how many days
lipstick stains and no underwear
I got a bad case of a band of bitches!

Oh oh
a band of bitches stole my life
a band of bitches stole my life
a band of bitches stole my life

My temperature is raising
I just need another fix
I'm trembling all night
now nothing is the same
I can still see them naked hanging around
I got a bad case of a band of bitches!

Oh oh
a band of bitches stole my life
a band of bitches stole my life
a band of bitches stole my life

I just want to see them again
oh oh!
I just want to see them again
oh oh!
I just want to see them again
oh oh!
I just want to see them again

"All set general
everybody is in their positions
we are ready to start operation 4808
code name: A band of bitches"
