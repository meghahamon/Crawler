I just wanna stack dough count more I dont know niggas
You ain't my bro you a hoe so you just dont get it
Bitches really tripping if you looking for a check go get it
Bitch, I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga, you fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong wrong nigga

Heres a couple words for you just incase you really dont get it
I can scoop any bitch I want but I wasn't gon' sweat it
Write me every minute wondering if i'm gon be there already
I put it in a song cause I couldn't fit it all in one message
So I know she gon' get it, I know she gon' get it
I dont put my time into the bitches they be tripping
I bet they wish they can all get me
I make you feel so special, I know this already
I know I'm fucked up but it's still fucked up how it happened now you gone baby
I, treated you so wrong baby, now how can we get along baby
I can't help it I've been selfish I know I was wrong baby
What the fuck was you expecting, I'm moving on baby
I did what I did now I gotta move on cause I feel like you just gone baby

I just wanna stack dough count more I dont know niggas
You ain't my bro you a hoe so you just dont get it
Bitches really tripping if you looking for a check go get it
Bitch, I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga, you fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong wrong nigga

Don't cross the line tryna line me
Dumb nigga lost his mind while he was thinking bout it
I wrote every single song don't try to copy
Fuck a niggas baby moms for tryna plagiarise me
My ex bitch so bad that she ain't around me
My ex bitch so mad made a mistake about me
I know you probably can't sleep you couldn't lay without me
Oh it's so so sad that you ain't around me
Can't believe I really made a whole tape about you
I made a song just to let you know I think about you
I don't even drink but everyday I drink about you
But, nowadays I don't give a fuck about you
Now I got a baddie sitting up in my coupe
Married to the money motherfucker I do
I'm rocking Buscemi even though I like Loubs
So you gotta use a key to walk in my shoes
They tryna keep up like the fuck do I do
Keeping it 100 like 50 times 2

I was the wrong nigga, wrong, wrong
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Wrong, wrong wrong
Wrong nigga, wrong nigga
Wrong nigga, wrong nigga
Wrong nigga wrong nigga, wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga, wrong nigga, wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga
