Fuck it im goin in now watch what i do to this
Nobody told me this shit i had to get used to it
Niggas thinkin im buggin they think im losing it
Micheal Jordan im ballin they think im hoopin it
She popped a perk and its workin so i go through with it
I sip a cup of the lean and then i go through with it
She moanin, screamin and tell me keep on doin it
Im A Boogie whats goodie baby im true to this
I pulled up in my hoodie so you could know its me
Ayo thats word to my F it ain't no hoe in me
A nigga talk behind my back thats a hoe to me
A nigga gave me his word and then he told on me
He ain't really hold it down, how its supposed to be
I shouldve put him in the ground,how its supposed to be
Bodies tryin to get found while im rollin' weed
Ski mask im hoping that they dont notice me
Choppa knock a nigga down on purpose
Ill pull up with a fuckin Trey Pound on pupose (Ah)
Ra Sosa got a thottie on me twerkin
Gotti with me waves lettin niggas tryin on purpose (Ah)
Nay Glizzy he a hound on purpose
Thats my dog ill never let him down on purpose
Bubba told me go wild on purpose
Nigga why the fuck you think im goin wild on em (Ah)
Im puttin pain on em'
Hollow tip i let it rip
I let i rain on em'
Fuck a hook i put a chain on em
I tie that shit round ya neck
I spill the brains on em'
