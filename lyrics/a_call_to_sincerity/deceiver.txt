Now I can say that
I know the game you play
as the pretty face you hide beneath
from your eyes and your misleading lips
to the thick limb stuck between your teeth

you can't prevent yourself to spit it out
you can't pretend that you're innocent

you can't wait for the day when you'll bring them down

with empty eyes and serpents tongue, we're running in circle
the perfection has never seems so real
so keep contracting your throat and swallow
it seems you love living your life with your stomach full

I've been here tonight and it's awaiting for you
I've been here tonight and you've done things you don't wanted to

show me truth before I trust you
remove this mask you wear
wash your regret before it's too late
face the mirror before meeting the fate

you face the crowd with your eyes wet
waiting the change, setting your best bet
you trying to rise...
you try to rise from the deepest depts

You face the crowd with your eyes wet
waiting the change, setting your best bet
you trying to rise
you try to rise from the deepest depts

I've been here tonight and it's awaiting for you
I've been here tonight and you've done things you don't wanted to

show me truth before I trust you
remove this mask you wear
wash your regret before it's too late
face the mirror before meeting the fate
