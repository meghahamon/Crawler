Right now it'sa face to face withourselves, withnorest I truelly hope we can help youto passthroughthis
Cause whenthere will be nothing more than will To cross these dried up seas
We might understand That this innerconflict isall we've got left Heart islike a candle andwhenit'smelt The wax's just flooding everything Taking it all away
It only covered the soundof the voice of unity It only mask the criesof ourhopesinsincerity It coveredthe sound of unity Masking the trust we've stuck insincerity
This is a call to Fire soignite the world Cause when there will be nothing more thandust Tobuild our shelter, would you keep trusting intheirwords?
Would you trust in theirfucking words?
Forget about what they're telling No, we can't be divided
