If you're going this way you're gonna be downed I'm holding yourhand but it meansno safety Where'syour pride inall this?
You're crawling away fromeverything you can't face Running tohide yourself, running to numb the conflict
You can build the bridge frombothsides Pilling the brickswith both hands
You won't pick how you want toquit Sojust pick up anexit My helphad toend So find your ownway to live You won't pick how you want toquit So please Release my handand walk away
Trust me, you're the one to blame
It's a constant fighting tofinddignity and grace Soyou have to struggle with all you possess
This life only reward the braves You saw the proofs, so just be yourself
Youneed tomake your steps You're not alone and you'll never be
You won't pick how you want toquit Sojust pick up anexit My helphad toend So find your ownway to live Release my handand walk away
