I am tireless but it feels like a need of sleep
I've only got sheep to count instead of hours slept
Yet I'm mute so I'll let my feather speak
So you would better be listening

I am writting what I truelly think
There's no flourish, just a darkened sheet
You will see no flourish, just a sat man thinking

The words are carved on me, and words after words, I'm still pensive
I am tired of this but you should read beyond the letters

Yet I'm mute so I'll let my feather speak
So you would better be listening
Yet I'm mute so I'll let my feather speak
So you should pay more attention

And I won't feed the hounds of my head

I will never let you define me
I will never lie to ease something
I swear I'll never regret a single thing
A single thing

The words are carved on me, and words after words, I'm still pensive
I am tired of this but you should read beyond the letters I have written

We all fail before setting sails
So just stand for something
We all fail before setting sails
We all need to stand for something
We all fail before setting sails
So just stand for something
