Use me like a punchbag
I'm too much for a cage of monkeys
Here they come from the hole
In the back of my head
Very carefully I stand
And I'll say, I'll call again

Use me like a punchbag
I'm too much for a cage of monkeys
Here they come from the hole
In the back of my head

Use me like a punchbag
Use me like a punchbag

Use me like a punchbag
Use me like a punchbag
