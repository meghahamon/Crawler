I’ve never lifted the morning blanket
Like I did when you first stayed
The clock I got don’t tell the truth
It’s too tall for here that’s why it lays
It’s noon at three and I’m rubbing shoulders
Rocks and boulders chasing me
Turn around and touch the ground
Now this game is history
You got to

Follow the fire into the hot one
Hook and sling one if you’ve got one
Burn all your burdens into the hot one
Follow the fire into the

You can be far too careful
When ambition is at your table
And if you talk of flow and motion
Do you know where I get the potion
And if I’m stood up straight through struggle
I’m surely worth my wait in rubble
You got to

Follow the fire into the hot one
Hook and sling one if you’ve got one
Burn all your burdens into the hot one
Follow the fire into the hot one
Follow the fire into the hot one
Hook and sling one if you’ve got one
Burn all your burdens into the hot one
Follow the fire into the hot one

La la la la la la la laaa whoooo
La la la la la la la laaa whoooo
La la la la la la la laaa whoooo

Nothing’s wrong when nothings said
And there’s nothing I like more than bed
To take the time to concentrate
To make the boat and not be late
And if you’re pleased to be an equal
Then drop the guard come join the people
You got to

Follow the fire into the hot one
Hook and sling one if you’ve got one
Burn all your burdens into the hot one
Follow the fire into the
Follow the fire into the hot one
Hook and sling one if you’ve got one
Burn all your burdens into the hot one
Follow the fire into the hot one
