Try and I fail, sometimes I even succeed
If you look at my life, I can't complain
If you know what I mean and it is all the same
When you're holdin' out you can wash in the rain

Wash in the rain, wash in the rain
Wash in the rain, wash in the rain

I got salt you got pepper
Maybe we could get it together
I dig a hole you fill it up
You're the second thing to knock me over
Only to the waves on the edge of the water

Wash in the waves, wash in the waves
Wash in the waves, wash in the waves
Wash in the waves

Find it hard to forget, all the effort in regret
Put in one pot that's big enough
It's bound to crack when it hits the rock
That 'cause you're wicked and you wouldn't stop
That 'cause you're wicked and you wouldn't stop

You wouldn't stop, you wouldn't stop
You wouldn't stop
