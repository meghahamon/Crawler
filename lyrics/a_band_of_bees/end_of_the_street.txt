I’ve got a girl and you’ve got a (wolf whistle)
I’m like a man and you’re like a (sumo grunt)
I’ve got a dog and you’ve got a (quack, quack)
I’m up a hill and you’re on the (clap, clap)

Edge of your seat and you think about where to go
To the end of the street and you think about where to go

You’ve got a home and I’ve got a (car horn)
You’re on the phone when I’m on the (toilet)
You’re in the dark and I’m in the (triangle ting)
You’ve got to stop when I’m on the (clap, clap)

Edge of my seat and I think about where to go
To the end of my street and I think about where to go
Well I’m going

Oooooohhh oooooohh oooooohh

I’ve seen a ghost and you seen a (werewolf)
I left a note and you leave a (hooter)
You’re on the road and I’m on the (bongo’s)
You’re in a mood and I’m in a (gong)
I’ve got a thing and you’ve got a (squeaky owl)
You’ve got it good and I’ve got it
I’m feeling weird and your feeling (bird whistle)
I’m coming back and you’re leaving
Bye bye
