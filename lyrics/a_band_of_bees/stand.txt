You can choose not to listen
To the words in a lie
You can choose if you want to
Stand by my side…by my side

Stand by my side
Stand by my side
Stand by my side

From the Garden of Eden
Come the seeds and the season
Living life without reason
And they know who they are
Don't come forward so much
Don't go back so far
When your presence is enough
You can stay where you are

When you’re out in the open
Where the sea meets the land
If you choose to stop running
Stand by my side …by my side

Stand by my side
Stand by my side
Stand by my side

When deeds are outspoken
And you work to the bone
Bequest that feeling and know who you are
Stay real to what matters
Stay still or you shatter
Your presence is enough
You can stay where you are
You can choose not to listen


To the words in a lie
You can choose .....
To stand by my side

Stand by my side
Stand by my side

Stand by my side
Stand by my side
