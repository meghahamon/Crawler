Was it you in the shadows?
I've got to get this right
Walking away
With your arms folded tight

Hits from the start, shakin' it
Hits from the start

How can I promise
I'll never let you down?
Put one word on me
I'm not the new man in town

Hits from the start, shakin' it
Hits from the start

Oh, that's so not the way
You should look at it
The effort in art, comes from the heart
A place that's blood red and hits from the start

Hits from the start, shakin' it
Hits from the start

Hits from the start, shakin' it
Hits from the start

Mister mister
Draw me that picture
Put your suit and tie on
And pour yourself a glass of wine

Hits from the start, shakin' it
Hits from the start

You're in buyers' hands
You can't really lose
Just the dough you spent
And all the paint you use

Hits from the start, shakin' it
Hits from the start

Oh, that's so not the way
You should look at it
The effort in art, comes from the heart
A place that's blood red and hits from the start

Hits from the start
Hits from the start

Hits from the start
The start
