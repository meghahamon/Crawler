He was thinking like a mad man
He was jealous on his own
And the sooner he figures
That he won't be going home

They left him the front key
Post it in when you go
Gave that man one more chance
To prove that there's no more

I have told you life's a worry and it's true
You're so serious so what is it with you

There never has been
So many rules crossed out in one
You can tell it to yourself
When you're the only one having fun

You remember the difference
Your held together my son
And the subtle suggestions
Dropped by everyone

I have told you life's a worry and it's true
You're so serious so what is it with you

It's a good song for someone
But who's that going to be
My appetite for soul tonight
Is begging down on me

If it rolls then it rocks
And if you don't push then it stops
If you see the people shouting out
You're allowed to shout out too

I have told you life's a worry and it's true
You're so serious so what is it with you
I have told you life's a worry and it's true
You're so serious so what is it with you

I wouldn't ask if you knew
He's not that sure of his charm
One more taste can't be a waste
Not where this ones from
