Saw you on the swings
You were looking at the sky
Turned around and told me
There's one reason why

You're the keeper of your dreams
And the dreamer of your sake
What do you dream of
When you're not awake?

I walked with you for hours
You gently held my hand
But our love's an hourglass
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand

Myths and legends stay
But stories fade away
And a story's what it is
Like what happened yesterday

You said it was okay
In the meadow where we lay
But then you went and cried
And the hourglass went dry

I walked with you for hours
You gently held my hand
But our love's an hourglass
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand

Then I said we'd keep in touch
So I guaranteed we must
Gather up the today
And let it settle in the dust

Just let one debt be let
You're a lady I'm a gent
The different ways we went
Were the different ways we went

And I walked with you for hours
You gently held my hand
But our love's an hourglass
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand

Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
