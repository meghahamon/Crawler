There's no atmosphere on the moon
Much like the vibe in the room
Cold, closed out, needs more fuel
Well, I guess it's too damn cool

Like old King Cole, he grew too old
Died and didn't get his wish
To be super rich, forever young
Well, I guess that's one step back

Well, that's one step back
That's one step back, step back

You know he didn't go without leaving a stitch to his wife
Who was a saucy dish
You know he owed her money and that's sort of funny
With no room to negotiate

Before he passed those pearly gates
And she made his grave from slate
It's not even straight, not even straight
[Incomprehensible]

Well, that's enough
Well, that's one step back
That's one step back

That's one, that's one step back
That's one step back
Well, that's one, that's one step back
That's one step back
