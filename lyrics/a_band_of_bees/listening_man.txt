Tell me something away from trouble and away from doubting
Tell me straight from the spirit, from the top of the mountain
Let love be the reason between me and you
As real as the morning as fresh as the dew
If fates got a hold then it's up to you
It's a simple thing you've got to do

just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Doing the best I can

Tell me something before I stumble and show my weakness
Tell me right on the line why I'm fighting for progress
I can hear it there's a sound that's coming through
There's a post in the ground so what we gonna do?
You can have all your dreams if you really believe in something real, in something true

Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Doing the best I can

Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Getting carried through this land

Tell me something without any lies that cover my feelings
Give me time now I understand these lessons have meaning
Let love be the reason between me and you
As real as the morning as fresh as the dew
If fates got a hold then it's up to you
It's a simple things you've go to do

Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Doing the best I can

Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Getting carried through this land
