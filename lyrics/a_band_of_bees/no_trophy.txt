Ask the river man
Where the river flows
Ask the postman
Who he knows

There's the memory
Of mistrust
Pushing at the glass
Makes it stop

Laid down dry
Head to head
This is it
What we want
Sold out

The figures that are left are lonely
You won but don't get no trophy

If you've got none to give
Then I won't take a thing
Oh, don't take a thing

The figures that are left are lonely
You won but don't get no trophy
No, no, no, no, no

Who will defend your bed tonight
Who will defend your bed tonight
