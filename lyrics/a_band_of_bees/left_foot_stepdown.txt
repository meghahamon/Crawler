I tremble down, if your love
Crumbles down, for my love
The pressure's down, when your love
Lifts me to the moon, like a dove

When your feelings get put to the ground
You can do the Left Foot Step Down.
Do yourself some right!

If you're being held back with the crowd
You can do the Left Foot Step Down.
Do yourself some right!

The word is love, when your life
Needs to be, full of light
And when the sun, meets the night
Prepare yourself for the world and the fight

When your feelings get put to the ground
You can do the Left Foot Step Down.
Do yourself some right!

If you're being held back with the crowd
You can do the Left Foot Step Down.
Do yourself some right!

Now you found, out your sound
Don’t be too proud, to turn around
Don’t let it pass, it’s here to last
Raise it up like a flag, on the mast

When your feelings get put to the ground
You can do the Left Foot Step Down.
Do yourself some right!

If you're being held back with the crowd
You can do the Left Foot Step Down.
Do yourself some right!
