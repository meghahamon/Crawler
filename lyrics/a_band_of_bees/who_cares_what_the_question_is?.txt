Who cares what the question is
When all your love is in messages
Glorious in tenderness
When they enter my mind
That's all you know
That's all you know

Take breaks on the hillside
Till the edge of a landslide
We can sail when the high tide
That's great, try the sun
That's all you know
That's all you know

Force push like carriages
With all your loving messages
Glorious in tenderness
When they enter my mind
That's all you know
That's all you know

Well, I’ve got my strategy
Mystic valiant category
Well, that's something you said to me
When you stayed by my side
That's all you know
That's all you know

Conform when you're organised
Why I can take you there for better than twice
We're carrying passages
With all their love and messages
Don't you know
Don't you know

You've got your character
You're not up and down like a temperature
If I’m rude I’d batter you
I'm saved by your love
That's all you know
That's all you know

That's all you know
That's all you know

(Who cares what the question is
When all your love is in messages)
That's all you know
That's all you know
