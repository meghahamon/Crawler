You wouldn't walk away
If my stories, they weren't true
I love you

It's only make believe
It's something that I do
I love you

Baby, there's no lies
I wouldn't make you cry
I love you

You're charming in my thoughts
With the magic that you brought
I love you

You wouldn't walk away
If my stories, they weren't true
I love you

It's only make believe
It's something that I do
I love you

Baby, there's no lie
I wouldn't make you cry
I love you

You're charming in my thoughts
Like the magic that you brought
I love you, love you

I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you

You wouldn't walk away
If my stories, they weren't true
I love you

It's only make believe
It's something that I do
I love you

Baby, there's no lie
I wouldn't make you cry
I love you

You're all I'm dreamin' of
You're the one and only love, love, love
