You’re valued as a keeper of a secret for me
Your intentions aren’t surrounded by brackets or thieves
There’s a spirit taking over its harder to restrain
Can you feel it? Here we go again, here we go again

It’s all right now, it should have really happened
Well it’s alright, this is for the better days

It all got started when this man said to me
Have you been away lately? It’s mad what you see
You can think of a theatre always on the go
Now that’s just like the way that you can let your love show

It’s all right now it should have really happened
Well it’s alright, this is for the better days
This is for the better days

Marching through the marsh
Keep a string from where you've been
Keep your scissors sharp then you can re-begin
Don’t get caught up in time already down the drain
Can you feel it, here we go again, here we go again

It’s alright now, it should have really happened
Well it’s alright, it’s alright
This is for the better days
This is for the better days
This is for the better days
It’s alright now, it should have really happened
Well it’s all right, it’s alright, this is for the better days

I trust the definition like Jack and the bean
Had he never sown it, then he never would have seen
The heights achieved are over the scale of you and me
If you’re jumping from conclusions then the moral will be

It’s alright now, it should have really happened
Well it’s alright, it’s alright
This is for the better days
This is for the better days
This is for the better days

This is for the better days
