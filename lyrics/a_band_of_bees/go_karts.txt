In the Sunday Times, there's an article
About me and all and our go-karts
Lots of fancy words about two sets of wheels
That go fast

And only last week the news was read to me

Full of reports that made all our thoughts
Feel really active

I think I should stand up and apply myself
For the benefit of you, yours and my health
There's plenty of room for advantage
It's the effort required that makes you so tired

It's funny what they chose to tell us
It's the head turning press that makes me suggest
The message we think that's important
Won't make the page today 'cause it won't pay
