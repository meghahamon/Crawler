I would like just one glass of water
And I would like to dance with your daughter
I would like if you would let me
Take your girl off to the party

I'd bring her home
Your one and only
Earn your word
And treat her purely

I would like a tree in a garden
That's big enough for us to climb on
Away from the world and it's burdens forgive me
Up in the leaves, we can be free and happy

I'm no King Kong
I may be hairy but don't get me wrong
I already told her, she can lean on my shoulder
For life, for life, for life, for life
For life, for life, for life

I would like just one glass of water
And I would like to dance with your daughter
I would like if you would let me
Take your girl off to the party

I'd bring her home
Your one and only
Earn your word
And treat her purely

I'm no King Kong
I may be hairy but not quite as strong
I already told her, she can lean on my shoulder
For life, for life, for life, for life
For life, for life, for life
