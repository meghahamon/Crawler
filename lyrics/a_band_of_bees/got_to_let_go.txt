I've got a job back in Texas
Cutting the grass before breakfast
Cleaning the park
I'm there til it's dark
But I'm saving up for a Lexus

I know it's fun
But I've got to leave
Over the sea with my family
Just for a smile
To be there for a while
And the difference is true
I will miss you

That's the way it is
As if it was planned
I've got to let go
If I still want your hand

When I return
I'll buy you a grand
You can play the piano
In your own little band

Stuff what they say
Just thrust it away
It was all said too fast
We must build this to last

I have the blood
Of a family man
Answer to the question
Ask as long as you can

It's gonna take
A change for the world
Change color and shape
Meets every boy and girl

That's the way it is
As if it was planned
I've got to let go
If I still want your hand
