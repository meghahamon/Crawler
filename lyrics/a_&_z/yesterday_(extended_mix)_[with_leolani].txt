The sounds nears our pride
Ever letting go
Ever letting go
oh the sun is my mind
Screaming on
To yesterday

Hold the night
(To my hands up in my head)
Hold the night
(To around to say)
Hold the night
(For the moment everyday)
To yesterday (To yesterday)

Hold the night
(To streaming in the day)
Hold the night
(To night u'll say)
Hold the night
(For the moment everyday)
To yesterday (To yesterday)
Sound and tears our price
Warning to what you say
Warning to what you say
Now alone with lie
Screaming out
To yesterday

Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
To yesterday (To yesterday)

Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
Hold the night
To yesterday

Hold the night
(To my hands up in my head)
Hold the night
(To around to say)
Hold the night
(For the moment everyday)
To yesterday (To yesterday)

Hold the night
(To streaming in the day)
Hold the night
(To night u'll say)
Hold the night
(For the moment everyday)
To yesterday (To yesterday)
