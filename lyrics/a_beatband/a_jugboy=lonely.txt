A Jugboy = Lonely by A Beatband
In the wind they got lost in the sky
But there's no action
So I just shake my head
And I put you on the line

A girl have only
I know the strength from a kiss
I could get it all to you
You

And then you ran away from the screams
You got as cold as I can be
You put your eyes in a box
I suck my soap from a bottle
There's a light it I could be
I say a Jugboy's lonely
I know no one
Who's gonna thrill me like you do

A girl toy only
His voice is crazy
About the color of my eye
But there's no action
So she just shook her head
And she put me on the line

A girl have only
I know the strength from a kiss
I could get it all to you
You
I want you

And then you ran away from the screams
You got as cold as I can be
You put your eyes in a box
I suck my soap from a bottle
There's a light it I could be
I say a Jugboy's lonely
I know no one
Who's gonna thrill me like you do

Got no head on baby
Got no shoes on baby
Got no face on baby
I say a Jugboy's lonely
Lonely
Lonely
