I had and I shine, I don't make no noise
I could be out in the rain
If my roof burn
Ride is ride and he sees them burnin'
Hard to loose from the shore
I make the moon fall

And I
I know my place
But I don't know
And I see Your face
But I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

I'm blind
so blind

I had and I shine, I ain't got no choice
That makes it change your pain
And the bell rang
White is white and the truth is turnin'
Hard to loose form the shore
I make the moon fall

And I see Your face
But I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

I'm blind
so blind

Oh mamma but the rain
Is a mono sound and a new old sound
But the rain gone
Yeah the rain gone

hey mamma
hey
