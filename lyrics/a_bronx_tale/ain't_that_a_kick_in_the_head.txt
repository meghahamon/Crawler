How lucky can one guy be?
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"

The room was completely black
And I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"

My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be beautiful

I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
"Tell me quick
Ain't love a kick in the head?"

Like the fella once said
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"
Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"

My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be beautiful

She's tellin' me, we'll be wed
She's picked out a king-size bed
I couldn't feel any better
Or I'd be sick

Tell me quick
Oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick
Ain't love a kick in the head?
