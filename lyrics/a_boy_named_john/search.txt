All my dreams and all my hopes crashed down on me the most, I drowned in my fears.
What is love, please be brave.
Don't fret your life away, I drowned in your fears.
One day in his shoes, and you'll wish you you've never been born.
He feared the light that strayed from his friends.
Writing home won't change a damn thing anymore, he swore he'd never do this to us.
That's when he said,
All my dreams and all my hopes crashed down on me the most, I drowned in my fears.
What is love, please be brave.
Don't fret your life away, I drowned in your fears.
He came back that day to forget his own name, to look in the mirror not to see, what was once the truth is now the cause for shame.
When you're with us you have your reasons to be, to be, to be.
All my dreams and all my hopes crashed down on me the most, I drowned in my fears.
What is love, please be brave.
Don't fret your life away, I drowned in your fears.
All I can hope for is sanctuary.
All I can hope for is sanctuary, no.
Don't run away, come back to us.
Oh, no. (All my dreams and all my hopes crashed down on me the most, I drowned in my fears.
What is love, please be brave.
Don't fret your life away, I drowned in your fears)
