Days are gone with your subconscious feelings.
You grew old before you knew it.
The breeze kicked in, the clouds set apart.
We were just kids learning to fall.

I knew I wasn't the only one that noticed I was away.
As the sun sets on your present ties, may the future be a gift.

Now your thoughts, they come from your youth like a tidal wave you can't escape.
Your memories remember you. You have no excuse this time.

I knew I wasn't the only one that noticed I was away.
As the sun sets on your present ties, may the future be a gift.

I knew I wasn't the only one that noticed I was away.
As the sun sets on your present ties, may the future be a gift.
