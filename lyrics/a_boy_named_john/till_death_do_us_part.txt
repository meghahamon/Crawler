Sleep well angel don't be scared
Too much to handle please understand.
Standing on the outside as your demons devise,
They're working against you it'll be over soon.

I'm gonna make love with a gun tonight,
It'll go down as a title fight.
Between me myself and I, and I won't think twice.
What good is there anymore if it's locked up in my mind?

Sleep well angel, don't be scared
Too much to handle please understand.
Standing on the outside as your demons devise,
They're working against you it'll be over soon.

Send another note I'm coming home,
There'll be one more cloud in the sky tonight.
The stars never seemed so close before as I walk out the door.
Gripping this love knowing it will take me somewhere else tonight.

Sleep well angel, don't be scared
Too much to handle please understand.
Standing on the outside as your demons devise,
They're working against you it'll be over soon.
