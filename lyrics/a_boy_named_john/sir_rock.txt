I'd hate to be the man
Who stands there with his hands tied
Watching as his world is torn to shreds.
The sense of shame collapsed on the golden door-step
Right next to all of her drunk friends.

So come on let me take the wheel,
I'll just be fine
Tell me really how you feel.
Oh no we are out of time,
Thank you for your thoughts
Now our show has begun.

Up against the wall
It seems as though we've lost control,
Hang on tight I'll take you for a ride.
You know it's not our fault,
Don't you see we feel alive,
Evil intents we have connived.

So come on let me take the wheel,
I'll just be fine
Tell me really how you feel.
Oh no we are out of time,
Thank you for your thoughts,
Now our show has begun.

Feel the sun wake up the town
The sense of time was lost with morale.
I'm so ashamed can you help me,
It'll be alright just get up off your two feet.

I'd hate to throw you under the bus,
But this is driving towards a night I wanna forget.
I'd hate to tell you you're so wrong,
But isn't it right to feel so much regret?
I'd hate to throw you under the bus,
But this is driving towards a night I wanna forget.
I'd hate to tell you you're so wrong,
But isn't it right to feel so much regret?

So come on let me take the wheel,
I'll just be fine
Tell me really how you feel.
Oh no we are out of time,
Thank you for your thoughts
Now our show has begun.
