When I was a young boy, my mother came to me, she said:
"Son you're gonna be okay" (okay).
Sometimes I wonder what fate had in store for me.
Why should I focus on the gray?

Every damn day or so it seems, your signals inclining towards me.
So let the rain shine on down, Oh, shine on down.

I just killed a whole community
of fruit flies in my head. (my head)
The infestation grew with immunity
as their lonely mouths were fed.

Every damn day or so it seems, your signals inclining towards me.
So let the rain shine on down, Oh, shine on down.
