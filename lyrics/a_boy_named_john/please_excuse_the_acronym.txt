Maybe, just maybe
When you have something to live for
Life stops being so sad
We're on this earth together
Every thought is a breath in and breath out
We live in this world together
Who are we to decide what's to live and what's to die
We hang by this rope together
We fucking play these games together
We're destroying this world together

I give the human race another ten years
before we kill the earth
Well isn't it clear?
Does it ring a bell?
The end of our time we'll take a look back
See our mistakes reflect then refract
Save us from ourselves.

So here's a toast to another new ending
Shatter my glass and stop defending
No, oh no.

We could've helped out sure we had the chance
Lights were dim, peer from a glance
Not as dim as you
Take a seat and shut your mouth
You'll soon learn what you can't live without.
You never had the crown

So here's a toast to another new ending
Shatter my glass and stop defending.
No, oh no.
It's about time for this dead soul to get tossed into her burial.
No self-control.

There goes the last of them,
The last creatures alive.
Come closer my good sir and wait for your prize.
We stand proudly and laugh at their demise.
(HAHAHA)
It's all part of my plan, to live till the end.

So here's a toast to another new ending,
Shatter my glass and stop defending.
No, oh no.
It's about time for this dead soul to get tossed into her burial.
No self-control.
