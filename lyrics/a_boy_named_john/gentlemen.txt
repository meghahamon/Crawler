It's okay, my love
There's no need to cry
To spare the tears
For another time, for another life
Somethings are better left unsaid
But now's the time to let it out
And free the thoughts locked inside your head

These so called "gentlemen" get away
The flowers have been plucked and set ablaze, set ablaze.

Your love is so crucial in days to come
Without it, we'll be no more
So how does it feel when she's covered in scars and crying on the floor?
Rose pedals on the floor.

So I'm here to share your story
'Cause I know it's tough to tell
Stake your claim
Don't feel ashamed
These sins will not sell
Scars will fade
You're not the one to blame
I feel your heart, I feel your pain
You're not fair game.

You are no "gentlemen".
