Maybe next year, maybe next year you'll be kind
Enough to say that, I was wrong, you were right. I'm sorry love."
All in all, all in all it was screwed.
To say I dressed up all nicely in front of cameras to hold you tight.

So who the hell drinks alone out of spite?
Who will close these doors after this time?
Eight shots in and you claim you're just fine,
But your shattered liver screams only reprive.

All in all, all in all we watched it go.
In the grass through the stars, we watched the fireworks I hoped for snow.
Maybe next year, maybe next year it'll be cold.
Enough to hold hands out of love, for entitlement it was rough.

So who the hell drinks alone out of spite?
Who will close these doors after this time?
Eight shots in and you claim you're just fine,
But your shattered liver screams only reprive.

So I'll throw you back down, to the place where you first sought for help.
I don't care if you don't call everyone you know.
Don't kill the messenger, she's trying to help the both of us.

So who the hell drinks alone out of spite?
Who will close these doors after this time?
Eight shots in and you claim you're just fine,
But your shattered liver screams only reprive.

Let's take a drive.
