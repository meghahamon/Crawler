I stayed up too late
Making memory aides
I haven't slept in days
Mmm, mmm
Haven't slept in days
Mmm, mmm

It's been weeks I haven't shaved
And I got no time to bathe
But I'm gonna get an A
Mmm, mmm
I'm gonna get an A
Mmm, mmm

Man this is gruelling
Can't stop, shovel food in
Should have tried home-schooling
Want my mom
Tell me it's gonna be alright

Cause the graders gonna grade grade grade grade grade
And the students gonna slave slave slave slave slave
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

Neck craners gonna crane crane crane crane crane
And complainers will complain plain plain plain plain
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

I'm cribbing off my sheet
Got papers to complete
And things are looking bleak
Mmm, mmm
Things are looking bleak
Mmm, mmm

I'm glancing at my notes
But I can't make out my prose
I don't know what I don't know
Mmm, mmm
Don't know what I don't know
Mmm, mmm

Man this is too hard
Forget these tiny cue cards
Pass that box of pure carbs
Stuff my face
Tell me it's gonna be alright

My eraser won't erase rase rase rase rase
And my straight edge isn't straight straight straight straight straight
Man I hate having to take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

Brain trainers gonna train train train train train
And my brain is gonna strain strain strain strain strain
Baby I don't wanna take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams

Hey hey hey
Just think, while you've been getting
Down and out about the style guides
And dirty multiple choice questions of the world
You could've been getting down
To this
Sick
Beet

My exam's got another question
But there's no time left and
I'm just gonna skip it
To the fella over there
With the hella squeaky chair
Quit your fidgeting
It's more than I can take, take, take

Procrastinators gonna pray pray pray pray pray
And the keeners gonna stay stay stay stay stay
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

Invigilators gonna wait wait wait wait wait
And the slackers show up late late late late late
Baby I'm just gonna take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

Some day I'll get a break break break break break
From this plainly awful fate fate fate fate fate
But for now I gotta take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

Then my grade may not be great great great great great
But I'll finally escape scape scape scape scape
But til thenI gotta take take take take take
Take exams, take exams

I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams

I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams
I, I
I take exams, I take exams
