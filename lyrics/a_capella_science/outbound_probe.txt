Next stop
That ice cold
No cell of life on that light globe
This one's for them dark worlds
Them dwarf worlds
Low mass-ter pieces
Chillin'
Millin'
Round in Kuiper Belt city
Some folks swoon
For Sailor Moon
But Pluto, mm, so pretty

She ain't hot
But hot damn
Got pole ice atop Charon and
She ain't hot
But hot damn
If this ain't a brand New Horizon, man
She ain't hot
But hot damn
Say my name I'm a Pluto fan
She ain't hot
But hot damn
Not a bad use of grant money
Break it down

Nix drifting into view yo
Hydra say benvenuto
Well so long Mars, and later Bruno

This outbound probe gonna visit Pluto
This outbound probe gonna visit Pluto
This outbound probe gonna visit Pluto
There's a planet inside of that little spot
Don't believe me just watch!
Come on!

SWAP
Pretty innit
Looking at gas as solar winds hit it
Alice sees ultraviolet
For radio we got REX
Then there's
PEPSSI
LORRI
Ralph, Venitia all ready
Got thrust streams
Of hydrazine
Locking in the whole thing steady

She ain't hot
But hot damn
Got dust collector and thermal scan
She ain't hot
But hot damn
Got her own plutonium power plant
She ain't hot
But hot damn
We finally get to see Pluto, planet or not
Hot damn
Got cameras up and running
Break it down

Styx, we sail away to you, yo
Kerberos, that ain't no poodle
We're almost there, break out the brew yo

This outbound probe gonna visit Pluto
This outbound probe gonna visit Pluto
This outbound probe gonna visit Pluto
Every night we get clearer shots
Don't believe me just watch
Come on

Outbound probe it up
