Robert is a black hole
You look around the sky you won't see him at all
He's got 100 solar mass
That got compressed real close back when his core collapsed
Yeah
He used to be a giant sun
With a billion-K middle making iron and nickel
That ran out in no time
Then his gravity won and he went supernova

All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They BETTER run, BETTER run
Outrun my pull
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They BETTER stay far away
Past their own Roche limit
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better run, better run
Outrun my pull
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
Like the Sun better run
Past their own Roche limit

Robert isn't so bright
He's blacker than night
We thought he don't emit light
'til Hawking found a surprise
And showed that if you leave him
He can thermalize
But Rob's too cool to just die
If he did we don't know
What happens to the information in his super mass
He could have hair or a firewall or not exist
Yeah

All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better run, better run
Outrun my pull
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better stay far away
Past their own Roche limit

All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better run, better run
Outrun my pull
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
Like the Sun better run
Past their own Roche limit

All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better run, better run
Outrun my pull
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
Like the Sun better run
Past their own Roche limit

All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better run, better run
Outrun my pull
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better stay far away
Past their own Roche limit

All the other stars with their puffed up cores
They better run, better run
Outrun my pull
All the other stars with their puffed up cores
Like the Sun better run
Past their own Roche limit
