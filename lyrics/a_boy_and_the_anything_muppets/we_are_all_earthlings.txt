Some of us have feathers
Some of us have fins
Some of us are furry
And some of us have grins
We swim and hop and slither
And leap and soar and run
We all live together on a planet of the Sun
We are all earthlings
We are all earthlings
Spinning around together on a planet of the Sun
We live in the desert
We live inside a tree
We live high in the mountains
Or deep beneath the sea
We live in tents and cabins
In houses just for one
And we all live together on a planet of the Sun
We are all earthlings
We are all earthlings
Spinning around together on a plant of the Sun
Floating down a river
Swinging through the trees
Climbing up the mountains
Going with the breeze
All of us can have a happy, healthy place to be
If we can float and swim and climb in earthling harmony
We are all earthlings
We are all earthlings
Spinning around together on a planet of the Sun
Spinning around together on a planet of the Sun
