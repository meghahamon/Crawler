You can call me mad dog, sweet dog
You can call me any name
You can call this mad love, sweet love
But dont leave us astray
Oh no, we believe
This is a love supreme
I can call you black cat, white cat
I can call you many names
Oh no, we believe
This is a love supreme
And youre doing it, youre doing it
Time and time again
You provoked twisted love
As you cast your wills
Upon the world today
(Mad love, sweet love)
You ignore the peoples laughter
You ignore this mad cup slain
You know just what youre after

Come and get it right away
Oh no, we believe
This is a love supreme
And youre doing it, youre doing it
Time and time again
You provoked twisted love
(Mad love, sweet love)
As you cast your wills
Upon the world today
(Mad love, sweet love)
I dont mind you talking dirty
It comes out so unashamed
(repeat)
Mad love, sweet love (4x)
And youre doing it, youre doing it
Time and time again
You provoked twisted love
(Mad love, sweet love)
As you cast your wills
Upon the world today
(Mad love, sweet love)
(Repeat)
