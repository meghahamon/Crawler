I want to confess as honest as I can
But your heart stopped beating
And I don't understand
A contradiction from the place you were in
Say it now
Surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
From the fire that's inside your eyes
Oh mother, send me to this land
Where I'll start sinking in an ocean of sand
Like the wish of some
Say it now
Surrender my soul
I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
From the fire that's inside your eyes
Please leave me alone
I'm so sick of the words that will show

All the hatred that's inside your mind

Say it now surrender my soul I'm so sick of the tears that will flow
