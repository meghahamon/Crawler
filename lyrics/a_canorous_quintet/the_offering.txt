Nightmares of what could have been
 Afraid of each reflection
 Feeling sickness in my horror world
 Strong emotions controls my being
 I am lost in the halls of death
 Please set me free

 Trapped within this orb of vain
 Afraid of the needles piercing my skin
 Hallucinations in my horror world
 Fleeing from the demons that haunt my sleep
 Please release me

 Accept my forbidden offering
 I’m empty and lost in my horror world
 Afraid of the shadow …. that burns in the night

 Free from the anger inside
 Afraid of the loss that I had
 Alone in my horror world
 Know I am one in body not soul

 At last I’ll be free

 Accept my forbidden offering
 Afraid of the shadow that burns in the night
 I’m empty and lost in my horror world
 Once I was one in body and soul

 Scars that will never heal
 Please leave me….be

 Nightmares of what could have been
 Afraid of each reflection
 Feeling sickness in my horror world
 Strong emotions controls my being…controls my being

 I am lost in the halls of death
 Please set me…free

 Trapped within this orb of vain
 Afraid of the needles piercing my skin
 Hallucinations…

 …in my horror world
 Where I am one in body and soul
 Scars that will never heal
 Please leave me be
 Free from the anger inside
 No longer afraid of the loss that I had
 Know I am one in body not soul
 At last I’ll be free
