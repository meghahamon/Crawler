Staring through it’s eyes
 Seeing things she shouldn’t see
 Pain filled dungeons, now she cries

 Praying for mercy, towards the walls she lean
 Hearing words, promised lies
 Filth before her eyes, never to be clean
 Finding truth in halls of flames
 Never-ending fields of rape

 Reflections of the mirror

 Harvest seeds of innocence
 As her life is filled with grief
 Joyless breath in loneliness
 Rage, fulfil her destiny

 Streams of deep red lift her wings
 Flying into the deepest cold
 Angel’s laughter as bells they ring
 Bloodshot eyes, the dragon’s rise
 Sands of time has now been turned
 Her heart is filled with…anger

 Once she sold her soul for love
 Judged by fire, forever burned

 Reflections of the mirror

 Sands of time has now been turned
 Her heart is filled with anger
 Once she sold her soul for love
 Judged by fire, forever burned
 Left to be forgotten in reflections of our living
 The only thing remaining, the whisper of her memory

 Streams of deep red lift her wings
