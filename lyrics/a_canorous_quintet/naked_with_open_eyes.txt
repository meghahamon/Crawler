[m: nirbrant/andersson l: andersson/hansen]

i watch the sun go down
as i feel the coldness crawling unto me
i'm sitting huddled up
trying to figure out the meaning of existence
yet i have found no ancwers (no ancwers at all)

i feel so small still i must be most
powerfull of all
suddenly it stood clear
there in the light of dawn
first sunbeams of day

a vision for me appeared
a thought to tame
behold life, meaningless and empty
what have we learned?
the awareness makes me scared
i don't mean to say that i am better in any way
it's just that i want something higher
