EMBRACED BY THE MIDWINTER FROST
THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS SLIPS AWAY
BLACK ROSES SURROUND THE FIELDS
STRANGE FLOATING LIGHTS, THEY FLOAT
ENDLESS VISIONS INTO FOREVER

ETERNITY THEIR BURNING SHADOWS
SPIRITS BREAK THE MIST
DESTINY TAKES THE FINAL TWIST
BEAUTY ARISE IN A FLOOD OF BRIGHT, (MAYBE LIGHT)
SCREAMS FILL THEIR LUNGS... SILENCE

TRAUMATIC VOYAGE FOR THE LOST
HORRIFIED IN THEIR EMPTY SHELLS
ALONE IN THE WORLD FULL OF LIFE
SADNESS THEIR ONLY DELIGHT
SILENCE OF THE DEAD, BEAUTIFULL AS HELL

ETERNITY THEIR BURNING SHADOWS
SPIRITS BREAK THE MIST
DESTINY TAKES THE FINAL TWIST

SCREAMS OF SILENCE
BEYOUND THE GATE OF EMPTINESS
THE WELL OF BURNING FRIGHT
LOST IN BETWEEN, ALL LIFE IS FORGOTTEN
EMBRACED BY THE MIDSUMMER BREEZE

BACK IN THE SILENCE OF THE WORLD BEYOUND (x2)

(rep. verse 2)

(rep. verse 1)

ETERNITY THEIR BURNING SHADOWS
SPIRITS BREAK THE MIST
DESTINY TAKES THE FINAL TWIST...
