[m: andersson l: hansen]

sanctuary for me has been banished
i search for forgivness
which i can not find

loosing myself, i am drained out of life
the silkblack shadows will take my mind

sadness and sorrow take my hands
as i ride the wings of destiny

the grief of others i share with pain
twisting and turning i'm longing for death
i'm within the blackest of black
all my wounds will burn me in flames
at the end of the rope i'll hang to be free

loosing myself, i am drained out of life
the silkblack shadows will take my mind

you hide from the daylight,
to shine the dark
lost in my own world of predestined fate

oh how i long to feel
i'm burning inside
the ashers remain
a hollow and empty shell
all alone, forever i am

the tender kiss of life
i have never felt, nor will i feel
embraced by death,
my last breath i take
the only one to whisper goodbye
is death that i greet whith my empty heart

embraced by death,
my last breath i take
the only one to whisper goodbye
is death that i greet whith my empty heart
all love is lost as i desolve in the wind
in vain i am gone
and that i regret
forgive but don't forget

[rep. verse 6, 3]

(all love is lost as i desolve in the wind
in vain i'm gone
and that i regret
forgive but don't forget)
