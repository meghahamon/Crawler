[m l: pignon]

i awake, gone is my dream
only it's mist fades away

back is fear and sadness
claiming my heart like a black hand
i cry as i refuse to accept this day
i want back the dream, unreality
in it's grasp i am free
onlu in it's domain can i live

now on this day i am powerless, pointless
i can not continue through this misery
here no spirits will guide me
and i wish for eternal life in fantasy

i am surrounde by a world of ignoranceand hate
yet it's my reality

i can not exceptit, so be it
i shall end my life
away fron reality
eternity unfolds

[rep. all verses]

(away from reality, eternity un)folds
