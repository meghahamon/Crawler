Didn't want to tell you "I told you" but look, I told you

Girl, I don't want your number, I want your soul, shoe
We can get money together, girl I can show you
Tell me whatever you want and I won't expose you
Bring another girl over that we can both do
Girl she can eat it up, eat it up like it's soul food
I could get fly any weather, pull up in snow shoes
I could get fly any weather, pull up in snow shoes
Gucci hat, Gucci sweater, I'm feeling so cool
Before I flooded the Bezel that shit was rose gold
It was a time when the money was moving so slow
I give the lawyer my money until the case close
It's whatever, my niggas gon' let that thing go
VVS's, they glitter up like a rainbow
VVS's, they glitter up like a rainbow
