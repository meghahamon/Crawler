How am I going to
Deliver you a mountain size of love?
How do oceans connected by a straw
Get something through?

I might need some time to remember
Need some time to remember

Hey! It's automatic when you know it
Hey! It's automatic when you feel it

When do I lay down
And get to see the world inside your eyes?
How can I reach out
And hold on to the joy you've got inside?

Hey! It's automatic when you know it
Hey! It's automatic when you feel it

I got some
But I wanna feel it every hour
Cuz I want to give it to you

Hey! It's automatic when you know it
Hey! It's automatic when you feel it
