Why don't you follow me
Through every tragedy
Unlock the hold so I can breathe again
It's never too late to turn around
Escape from here before you drown
Remember to walk before you run again

Remember to hold your last breath inside
You fail to see your mind in need, In your eyes

I saw this coming
And I've been running
Passing by my floating memories
I want to find a place
To hide from this endless race
Running in circles but in fake degrees

Remember to hold your last breath inside
You fail to see your mind in need, In your eyes

Why don't you follow me
Through every tragedy
Unlock the hold so I can breathe again

Remember to hold your last breath inside
You fail to see your mind in need

(hold your breath inside)
(You fail in your mind)
(I saw it was over)
