People unite
People stand up
Look at ourselves
And what we've become

We build our lives, our society
On information technology
We put our trust in bits and bytes
Power consumption
Turn off the lights
Too many options for us to care
Too many choices vanish in the air
What's it good for?
Have we lost the way?
Things that matters
Have they come astray?

People unite
People stand up
Look at ourselves
And what we've become

Our lives are spinning way too fast
No common sense reflect the past
Where are we heading
No one can tell
Are we too scared to break the spell?
