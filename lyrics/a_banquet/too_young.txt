Like a strained winged shadow
Is the noose that binds
The noose that binds

Everything that stands out
Until it dies
Until it dies

I am too young to walk the line
I wanna live, is that a crime?
I am too young to walk the line
I wanna live, is that a crime?

I've been told to watch out
All my life
All my life, yeah

But I'm not a good boy, baby
I will strive
For being alive

I am too young to walk the line
I wanna live, is that a crime?
I am too young to walk the line
I wanna live, is that a crime?

I'm too young
I'm too young

I am too young to walk the line
I wanna live, is that a crime?
I am too young to walk the line
I wanna live, is that a crime?

I am too young to walk the line (I'm too young)
I wanna live, is that a crime? (Too young)
I am too young to walk the line (I'm too young)
I wanna live, is that a crime? (Too young)
