Far away
where everything is pure and clear
Far away lies a place
made of infinity

It's far away
but everything is near
It's far away
and not

Does that make any sense to you?

At this place
I can see anything I want
but I wanna see you

It's far away
but even if we are apart
I know the place
where I can find you

I know where to find you
I know where to find you
I know where to find you
I know where to find you

And this place
knows everything you've done or felt
No falsity at all
you can't pretend

It's far away
but to get there I need no time
'cos it feels
I miss you now

aaaaa
aaaaa
aaaaa

I know where to find you
I know where to find you
I know where to find you
I know where to find you

I know where to find you
we're not apart
I know where to find you
inside my heart

I know where to find you
we're not apart
I know where to find you
inside my heart
I know where to find you
we're not apart
I know where to find you
inside my heart
