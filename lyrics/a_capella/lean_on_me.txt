Lean on me
When you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Some times in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that theres
Always tomorrow
Lean on me
When you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can feel
Those of your needs
That you don't let show
Lean on me
When you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

You just call on me brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
That you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me
When you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on

For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
Just call on me brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
That you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me when you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
I will be here from now on
