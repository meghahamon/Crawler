In the hands of time,
A future that is blind,
Keeps me questioning the view.
Could destiny unfurl,
Halfway around the world?
Would it lead me home to you?

Ooooh yeaaah!
All we have are moments.
Ooooh yeaaah!
All we have are moments...
(Could you be the one?)

These fleeting moments.
Bring me close to you,
Through the distance.
These fleeting moments,
Fleeting moments,
Almost make me feel,
That you're hereâ€¦

Shackled to our lives,
Uncompromising minds,
Separating every try,
Could destiny unfurl,
Halfway around the world?
For the chance of you and I
