In the hands of time
A future that is blind
Keeps me questioning the view
Could destiny unfurl
Halfway around the world?
Would it lead me home to you?

Ooooh ahhhh yeaaah!
All we have are moments
Ooooh ahhhh yeaaah!
All we have are moments
(Could you be the one?)

These fleeting moments
Bring me close to you
Through the distance
These fleeting moments
Fleeting moments
Almost make me feel
That you're here

Shackled to our lives
Uncompromising minds
Separating every try
Could destiny unfurl
Halfway around the world
For the chance of you and I?

These fleeting moments
Bring me close to you
Through the distance
These fleeting moments
Fleeting moments
Almost make me feel
That you're here
