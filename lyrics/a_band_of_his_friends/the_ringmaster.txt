There's a circus in my head
and then the ringmaster said
that all of the clowns are dead
and then he took me from bed
through dark, murky waters, we tread
with an axe in his hands, stained with red

I follow the Master duly,
then look o'er my shoulder and see
a spectre flying at me
I ask the Master, myself, free
I plea and I plea and I plea
I break 'way and I start to flea

I return to my caravan
followed slowly by the man
I can take it no more
and then from behind the door
rising up from the floor
the ghost - I was done for!

Il y a un cirque dans ma tête
et puis le maître a dit
que tous les bouffons sont morts
et puis il m'a fallu du lit
aux travers les eaux il marchait
avec une hache rouge dans ses mains
