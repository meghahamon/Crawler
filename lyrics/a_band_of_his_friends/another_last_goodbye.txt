He jumps off a bridge and is disappointed when
His bungee brings him back, and brings him back again.
He's the man that we all know but no-one loves to love.
How can he do this to himself? How can he do this to himself?

He downs another bottle and he wakes a single man.
His head is sore, his eyes are wet, he doesn't understand
Why he's in the A&E and just who got him there.
Does he really care? Does he really care?

He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.
He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.

He leaves the ones he loves, but he never stops to grieve.
His so-called apathy makes up for his lack of belief.
He says he doesn't hurt and he says he doesn't cry.
He knows how to lie. He knows to lie.

He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.
He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.

He rubs his wrists so he can feel the pain he never lost:
The emptiness he feels inside is not the only cost.
He longs for those days in which he felt he could not die;
when any greeting was not followed by a last goodbye.

He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.
He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.
He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.
He doesn't want no fuss or moan. He says he wants to be alone.
But those who he lets closer know that that's not always so.
