My Dove, you have helped me through
my toughest times, I love you.
You've been there when I needed a friend
and you're the wisest sage with heaps of knowledge to lend
You've known heartache and love and you've felt my pain,
you've drunk the finest sherry from an eggcup in the rain.
Though apathy is more desirable than
the cruelest oceans from when love began
Your happiness still seems warmer
than love from any former performer.
Am I subconsciously abducting you again?

A million thanks is not enough
for helping me out when times are tough,
and I think the others will agree
you are a dove for helping me

You know me better than I know myself,
not that I even know myself, but
You're prepared to tell me who I am,
who I want, and what I want from them.
You've been there to hold my hand,
and you rested my head in the sand.

A million thanks is not enough
for helping me out when times are tough,
and I think the others will agree
you are a dove for helping me

A million thanks is not enough
for helping me out when times are tough,
and I think the others will agree
you are a dove for helping me
