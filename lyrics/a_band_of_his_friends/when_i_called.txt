I wanted to help you but you wouldn't let me.
I told you that I loved you, but you hadn't met me.
You don't know who I am, you pushed like the tide.
But you'll say you know me and you'll join me for the ride

But when I called on you, you were not there.
I spent an hour waiting in the library square
after the longest weekend of my life

A week had passed, and 2 more followed;
from future to past with deep breaths, I swallowed
and you read my thoughts but gave me no help
look at what it brought; I still need your help

But when I called on you, you were not there.
I spent an hour waiting in the library square
after the longest weekend of my life

And even now, times don't change though you needed me
I still find it strange that you didn't ask about me
and although I love you and you claim the same
I see no difference between you two, except she doesn't maim,

And in this game, you shift the blame to me
and you threw it all to the flame and say it is a shame
that I became like you

But when I called on you, you were not there.
I spent an hour waiting in the library square
after the longest weekend of my life

I really hope it's gone, cos this heartache could only lead
for me to carry on, carry on and bleed
but I'm not with you enough for this love to last
for me, it is so tough not to dwell in the past.

But when I called on you, you were not there.
I spent an hour waiting in the library square
after the longest weekend of my life

But when I called on you, you were not there.
