I want to bruise your skin
I want to let my teeth sink in
and leave my scars but I don't know where to begin

We live in an exsanguination nation
We enjoy our mutilation
and accept our fate in damnation
For we are exsanguination nation

You want to see my fangs?
Well, honey, I don't give a damn
about you any more

We live in an exsanguination nation
We enjoy our mutilation
and accept our fate in damnation
For we are exsanguination nation

I want to gnash and snarl and bite,
honey, what gave you the right
to tell me I was a delight for you to have?

We live in an exsanguination nation
We enjoy our mutilation
and accept our fate in damnation
For we are exsanguination nation
