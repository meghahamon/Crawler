The marks on her wrist mark a dark, dark past.
Her eyes show the ones she used to know.
She runs, with him - she runs so fast
away from the flying crow.

The crow, with wings as dark as night
manifested in her dreams.
Fight, or flight, try as you might,
he will tear apart your seams

Run, Run, Run
Run so far away from me.
Run, Run, Run,
What do you say, can I let you be?

The crow lays dormant while the sands of time
build a beach to be called "Calling".
The night we shared was truly sublime,
but you awoke with a sense of falling.

Run, Run, Run
Run so far away from me.
Run, Run, Run,
What do you say, can I let you be?

How you laughed, how you made me sing,
How the food that we shared was divine.
How you mean everything to me.
Everything will be fine.

Run, Run, Run
Run so far away from me.
Run, Run, Run,
What do you say, can I let you be?

Run, Run, Run
Run so far away from me.
Run, Run, Run,
What do you say, can I let you be?
