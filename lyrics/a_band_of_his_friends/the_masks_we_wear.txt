So, you used to have a life you never dreamed would disappear,
but something changed and now you stay, alone, inside your room.
Perhaps I understand, perhaps I have been there.
Love has a way of sealing everyone inside its sullied tomb.

Sometimes you leave your world behind and step outside your house.
You grab your guise that you leave, like Lady Madonna, by the door.
The battered thing you wear won't show you, timid as a mouse,
as you attempt both to survive and prevent it from breaking more.

Maybe we are the masks we wear,
Do you even know what your face looks like when it's bare?
Maybe you're just broken there,
Maybe you just live in fear that one day you will find yourself.

Perhaps one day you find some friends you'd never dared to make.
Perhaps you'd choose to tell them of your past.
Perhaps they'd understand the courage telling them would take.
Perhaps you've found new hope at last.

Maybe we are the masks we wear,
Do you even know what your face looks like when it's bare?
Maybe you're just broken there,
Maybe you just live in fear that one day you will find yourself.

Oh, behind your lowered mask, I see eyes of brilliant jade,
Made-up skin, a vivid grin; maybe we've gotten through
to the person hiding deep inside, eternally afraid.
Maybe we have gotten through to you.

Maybe we are the masks we wear,
Do you even know what your face looks like when it's bare?
Maybe you're just broken there,
Maybe you just live in fear that one day you will find yourself.

Maybe we are the masks we wear,
Do you even know what your face looks like when it's bare?
Maybe you're just broken there,
Maybe you just live in fear.
