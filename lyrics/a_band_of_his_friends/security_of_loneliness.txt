I watch the man run away amidst my shattered dreams.
I watch him run for a year, or more, as so it seems.
He runs, not from himself, but from his encroaching fears.
He stops and falls to the ground, with his falling tears.

He's stopped because he's given up; He's tired of running away.
Your fears are approaching, friend, they'll arrive within the day.
The darkness overshadows him, then falls into his arms.
He holds the darkness safe, secure; saving it from harm.

Little man, little man.
Run away while you can.
Run away, run away.
Little man, do not stay.

For his fear is of loneliness, but he holds her tender soul.
When he is with loneliness, her half makes him a whole.
He stays ever still, tears flowing freely down his face.
His whole is still not a full, and so he stays in place.

Little man, little man.
Run away while you can.
Run away, run away.
Little man, do not stay.

The running man has fallen down, with pride and loneliness.
He reflects that he does not know why he gave in to his distress.
I yell to the shattering man, "get up and go on, please!"
The mirrors breaks and I fall down onto my hands and knees.
