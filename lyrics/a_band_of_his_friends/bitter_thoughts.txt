I saw my old friend walking with someone the other day.
A really very quite bizarre sight, even if I do say so.
She was walking with her murderer, and it was plain to see.
And when he turned around, I found her murderer was me.

Let me tell you what I did:
I sliced her with a knife that I made from my bitter thoughts,
And with my glares I did ensnare her with my strangling garrote.
She stole my heart, then said we'd part, so I stole her heart too,
My dead best friend has met her end and it's the last thing she will do.

Yet here I find here on the streets that she still follows me,
I knew that she'd come crawling back, as sure as sure can be.
But all she does is stand and stare and snigger with that man
I've got to her one time before, I'll just repeat my plan.

Let me tell you what I did:
I sliced her with a knife that I made from my bitter thoughts,
And with my glares I did ensnare her with my strangling garrote.
She stole my heart, then said we'd part, so I stole her heart too,
My dead best friend has met her end and it's the last thing she will do.

Months and weeks and days have passed since I killed her in my heart.
Maybe then killing her wasn't very smart.
But now it's done, and it was fun, I shan't show any remorse.
If she shows her face again in this place, I'll do what I did before.

Let me tell you what I did:
I sliced her with a knife that I made from my bitter thoughts,
And with my glares I did ensnare her with my strangling garrote.
She stole my heart, then said we'd part, so I stole her heart too,
My dead best friend has met her end and it's the last thing she will do.
