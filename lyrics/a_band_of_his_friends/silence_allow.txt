Oh sweetheart, you could come to mine and I could show you a good time
or we could go to yours and you'd be down on all fours, but now you're
shaking your head 'cos you don't wanna go to bed
you wanna lie down in the grass and just stare at the stars
well, honey that's quite alright with me,
that's all I wanna do with you.

And now the stars above us read that there is nothing else we need
in the shapes they start to form, and in the calming of the storms inside of us.
Inside of us.
Oh, let me tell you of a thought: stars are embraces we have sought;
the dimmer ones, our memories - the brightest futures still we see.
You say you've heard that before, in a dream or something more.
But my dream is both here and now, still I don't speak, silence allow.

Oh sweetheart, you could come to mine and I could show you a good time,
lying on our backs, listening to record tracks, and now you're
nodding your head because you're liking what I said
and now you're wanting something new, and I'm wanting something too.
well, honey that's quite alright with me,
that's all I wanna do with you.

And now I'm wishing you were real, and these were feelings I could feel
well maybe I am justscared of 'us'.
maybe I'm ever-afraid, maybe that's just the way I'm made
and I have no sense of home, and I'm feeling quite alone
well, honey that's quite alright with me,
that's all I wanna be.
