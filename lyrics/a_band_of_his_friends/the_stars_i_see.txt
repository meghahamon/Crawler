She took his hand and said "let's go,
I have some things I'd love to show you.
I wish that you could see the stars I see."
So then she took him up so high
and pointed out as they went by
the ones she loved, but he stayed on the ground alone there.

She soared, and on the ground he dreamt.
She sighed because she was content.
The talked but they never said much.

She touched his heart so he took her
to a playground at his old school.
Little did he know she loved him; he could not emulate her.
Then she grew and then he grew
and then they knew that unlike glue,
they'd never stick together just the two.

They went their seperate ways one night.
They wept 'cos it did not feel right.
Only then did the spark ignite for him.

She sung a song she wrote for him
a lovely song, a sacred hymn
and then he saw a glimpse of love.
And so he wrote this song for her.
but in his eyes, nothing ever will.

She took his hand and said "let's go,
I have some things I'd love to show you.
I wish that you could see the stars I see."
