A fickle taste of heaven lingers in my sight,
enforced ever more by my visions in the night.
Skeletons and Crows and things, dancing in my head...
One would think the songs would stop when I rise from bed.

These are the phantoms you have brought.
These are the worries I have sought.
These are the phantoms you have brought.
These are the worries I have sought.

Tired more than tortured now, but tortured nonetheless.
Empathy turned apathy; disdain, I confess.
Confusion and helplessness: some things that we both feel.
Even if they are the only things we feel.

These are the phantoms you have brought.
These are the worries I have sought.
These are the phantoms you have brought.
These are the worries I have sought.

However, we both know the way that lies ahead:
One path gives us life, the other, us, unlead.
Deep morosity and pain shows us the latter path.
The helping hand you ignore will only flatter with its wrath.

Visions, and illusions, and the dreams you left behind.
The raging storm inside my head; destruction of my mind.
Ubiquity and deviation; death and life alike.
We are united once again by shared love and dislike.

These are the phantoms you have brought.
These are the worries I have sought.
These are the phantoms you have brought.
These are the worries I have sought.
These are the phantoms you have brought.
These are the phantoms I have sought.
