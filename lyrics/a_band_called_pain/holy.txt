I can't wheel
I can't deal
Since you walked out on me
Holy smokewhat you doing to me?
I can't eat
And I can't sleep
Since you walked out on me
Holy cowwhat you doingchildchild?

(what you doingwhat you doingchild? )
Holy smokewell it ain't no joke

First my boss
The job I lost
Since you walked out on me

Holy smokewhat you doing to me?
Walking the ledge
Nerves on edge
Since you walked out on me
Holy cowwhat you doing to mechild?
Holy cowwhat doingchild?
(what you doingwhat you doingchild? )
Holy smokewell it ain't no joke
(no joke) heyheyhey
Holy cowwhat doingchild?
(what you doingwhat you doingchild? )
Holy smokewell it ain't no joke
