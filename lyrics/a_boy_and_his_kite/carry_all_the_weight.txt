i'll know soon if it's the cold hard truth
that all i have wagered i could lose
all but you
i'll konw soon if it's the chance to prove
that all i have gained is worth it's due
all but you
i will carry all the weight, carry all the weight
hold you in my arms. i won't let you fall. i wont let you faint
i will carry all the weight, carry all the weight
hold you in my arms. i wont let you break
i'll know soon if it's a win i'll have proof
that all i have wagered will come true
holding you
