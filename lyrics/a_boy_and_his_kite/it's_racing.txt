Maybe I can try come on baby I have to fight
Fire with flames burning up, bellowing inside
All is safe
No wound too deep to break
My heart will pace this fight it has to make
All the way our love will be the same
Till darkness fades into light

Maybe I can try come on baby I have to fight
Fire with rain pouring down, washing up the flame
All is safe
No wound too deep to break
My heart remains this fight it has to make
All the way our love will be the same
Till darkness fades into light

Can you feel my heart
It's racing
It's chasing
Can you feel my heart
It's racing
It's chasing you
Chasing you

Maybe I can try come on baby I have to fight
Fire with flames burning up, bellowing inside
All is safe
No wound too deep to break
My heart will pace the fight it has to make
All the way our love will be the same
Till darkness fades into light

Can you feel my heart
It's racing
It's chasing
Can you feel my heart
It's racing
It's chasing you
Can you feel my heart
It's racing
It's chasing
Can you feel my heart
It's racing
It's chasing you
Chasing you
Chasing you
Chasing you
Chasing you
