Looking for a still small voice inside
It echoes past whispering where to find
A light that shines stronger than darkness hides
It's a sea of bright
Oh I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I see the light

You want it, you got it
Oh everything
Your love, yeah it always, lights a fire in me

Holding on to the words that ring my soul
Screaming out
Shaking my bones, shaking, shaking
I'm on the floor

You want it, you got it
Oh everything
Your love, yeah it always, lights a fire in me
You want it, you got it
Oh everything
Your love, yeah it always, lights a fire in me

I am blind
And I see a bright light
I am blind
And I see a bright light
I am blind
And I see a bright light
