give it up death, go on and resign
your stinger is broke and your venom is dry
move it out, you sins that malign
you're drowned by my perfect fire, my perfect light
won't you be mine
i'll love you till the end of time
won't you be mine
i'll love you till the end of time
i was the first born of many that none should die
i was born under a star that proclaimed my rights
my father was the author of life.
my mother the holy virgin purified
i spent forty days and forty nights
with no food or drink, just in my mind
i reached out my hand and gave you sight
i turned your dirty water into wine
so untie those knots that bind
for no man or law can grant you life
cast out your nets to the other side
drink deep from my well that satifies
