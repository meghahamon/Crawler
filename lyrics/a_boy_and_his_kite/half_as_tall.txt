i met a man who was half as tall
in his mind then against the wall
he was standing on his knees
i met man who was half as wise
in his mind and in his eyes
they were bloodshot from all he'd seen
when the words that we hear
echo through the years
when the thoughts that we've wrought
take root in our hearts
when the echo's of doubt creep up and out of your mouth
won't you bury them six feet under
i met a man who was half as bold
in his heart than what his muscles could show
he was weak in the knees
i met a man who was half as rich
in his heart than what his income could fix
wash it out, this tide is cleansing
it's pouring in and the water's rising
flowing in, your voice changing
hear it out and the sound is deafening
you're twice as strong. you're twice as bold
no more believing what you've been told
