It's gonna feel like fire
It's gonna hurt like hell
It's gonna feel like water pouring down an old dry well
It's gonna feel like crawling up a rocky hill
It's gonna feel like falling off a cliff
Man heart take a spill

All that feat's, holding onto hopes that meet
All of the good men, good men
All that feat's, holding onto hopes that meet
All of the good men, good men

It's gonna feel like sinking
It's gonna pull down deep
It's gonna feel like soaring high above the lofty peaks
It's gonna feel like pressure bearing down on me
It's gonna feel like freedom
Come on heart set it free, set it free

All that feat's, holding onto hopes that meet
All of the good men, good men
All that feat's, holding onto hopes that meet
All of the good men, good men

Don't bend
Don't break
Don't bend
Don't break
Don't bend
Don't break

All that feat's, holding onto hopes that meet
All of the good men, good men
All that feat's, holding onto hopes that meet
All of the good men, good men
