Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old santa claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, christmas joys
Ho, ho ho! who wouldn't go? ho, ho ho! who wouldn't go?

Up on the housetop, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old saint nick

First comes the stocking of little nell
Oh, dear santa fill it well
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries
One that will open and shut her eyes
Ho, ho, ho! who wouldn't go? ho, ho, ho! who wouldn't go?

Up on the housetop, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old saint nick

Next comes the stocking of little will
Oh, just see what a glorious fill
Here is a hammer and lots of tacks
Also a ball and a whip that cracks
Ho, ho ho! who wouldn't go? ho, ho, ho! who wouldn't go?

Up on the housetop, click, click, click
